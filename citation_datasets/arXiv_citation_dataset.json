Recent works have\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of such GNNs in replacing the branching\n(variable selection) heuristic in branch-and-bound (B&B) solvers. These GNNs\nare trained, offline and on a collection of MILPs, to imitate a very good but\ncomputationally expensive branching heuristic, strong branching. Given that B&B\nresults in a tree of sub-MILPs, we ask (a) whether there are strong\ndependencies exhibited by the target heuristic among the neighboring nodes of\nthe B&B tree, and (b) if so, whether we can incorporate them in our training\nprocedure. Specifically, we find that with the strong branching heuristic, a\nchild node's best choice was often the parent's second-best choice. We call\nthis the \"lookback\" phenomenon. Surprisingly, the typical branching GNN of\nGasse et al. (2019) often misses this simple \"answer\". To imitate the target\nbehavior more closely by incorporating the lookback phenomenon in GNNs, we\npropose two methods: (a) target smoothing for the standard cross-entropy loss\nfunction, and (b) adding a Parent-as-Target (PAT) Lookback regularizer term.\nFinally, we propose a model selection framework to incorporate\nharder-to-formulate objectives such as solving time in the final models.\nThrough extensive experimentation on standard benchmark instances, we show that\nour proposal results in up to 22% decrease in the size of the B&B tree and up\nto 15% improvement in the solving times.\n",

In real-world graphs, nodes are\noften mislabeled, which can significantly degrade the robustness of GNNs. To\nmitigate the detrimental effect of the low-quality training nodes, we present\nCLNode, which employs a selective training strategy to train GNN based on the\nquality of nodes. Specifically, we first design a multi-perspective difficulty\nmeasurer to accurately measure the quality of training nodes. Then, based on\nthe measured qualities, we employ a training scheduler that selects appropriate\ntraining nodes to train GNN in each epoch. To evaluate the effectiveness of\nCLNode, we conduct extensive experiments by incorporating it in six\nrepresentative backbone GNNs. Experimental results on real-world networks\ndemonstrate that CLNode is a general framework that can be combined with\nvarious GNNs to improve their accuracy and robustness.\n",

In this paper, we present Callipepla, an accelerator\nfor a preconditioned conjugate gradient linear solver (CG). FPGA acceleration\nof CG faces three challenges: (1) how to support an arbitrary problem and\nterminate acceleration processing on the fly, (2) how to coordinate long-vector\ndata flow among processing modules, and (3) how to save off-chip memory\nbandwidth and maintain double (FP64) precision accuracy. To tackle the three\nchallenges, we present (1) a stream-centric instruction set for efficient\nstreaming processing and control, (2) vector streaming reuse (VSR) and\ndecentralized vector flow scheduling to coordinate vector data flow among\nmodules and further reduce off-chip memory accesses with a double memory\nchannel design, and (3) a mixed precision scheme to save bandwidth yet still\nachieve effective double precision quality solutions. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first work to introduce the concept of VSR for data\nreusing between on-chip modules to reduce unnecessary off-chip accesses for\nFPGA accelerators. We prototype the accelerator on a Xilinx U280 HBM FPGA. Our\nevaluation shows that compared to the Xilinx HPC product, the XcgSolver,\nCallipepla achieves a speedup of 3.94x, 3.36x higher throughput, and 2.94x\nbetter energy efficiency. Compared to an NVIDIA A100 GPU which has 4x the\nmemory bandwidth of Callipepla, we still achieve 77% of its throughput with\n3.34x higher energy efficiency.

However, prior pooling works extract only the local\ncontext of the activation maps, limiting their effectiveness. In contrast, we\npropose a novel non-local self-attentive pooling method that can be used as a\ndrop-in replacement to the standard pooling layers, such as max/average pooling\nor strided convolution. The proposed self-attention module uses patch\nembedding, multi-head self-attention, and spatial-channel restoration, followed\nby sigmoid activation and exponential soft-max. This self-attention mechanism\nefficiently aggregates dependencies between non-local activation patches during\ndown-sampling. Extensive experiments on standard object classification and\ndetection tasks with various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures\ndemonstrate the superiority of our proposed mechanism over the state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) pooling techniques. In particular, we surpass the test accuracy of\nexisting pooling techniques on different variants of MobileNet-V2 on ImageNet\nby an average of 1.2%. With the aggressive down-sampling of the activation maps\nin the initial layers (providing up to 22x reduction in memory consumption),\nour approach achieves 1.43% higher test accuracy compared to SOTA techniques\nwith iso-memory footprints. This enables the deployment of our models in\nmemory-constrained devices, such as micro-controllers (without losing\nsignificant accuracy), because the initial activation maps consume a\nsignificant amount of on-chip memory for high-resolution images required for\ncomplex vision tasks. Our proposed pooling method also leverages the idea of\nchannel pruning to further reduce memory footprints.\n",

It leads to severe theoretical inconsistencies. For instance, the\nmasses and the decay constants would no longer be independent of the momentum.\nIn this work, we provide a systematical approach to resolve this problem. The\nmeson decay constants as well as the baryon transition form factors can be\ncomputed consistently in our framework. Notably, the form factors in the\nneutron $\\beta$ decays do not depend on any free parameters, and are determined\nto be $F^V_1 =1 $ and $F^A_1 = 1.31$ or $F_1^A/F_1^V= 1.31$, which is close the\nexperimental value of $F^A_1/F^V_1 = 1.27$. In addition, we find that ${\\cal B}\n(\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda \\gamma) = (6.8 \\pm 3.3 ) \\times 10^{-6} $, which agrees\nto the experimental value of $(7.1\\pm 1.7)\\times 10^{-6}$.\n",

The study aims to leverage spatial\ndependencies through the relative physical location of different measurement\nstations to improve local wind forecasts. Our multi-step forecasting models\nproduce either 10-minute, 1- or 4-hour forecasts, with 10-minute resolution,\nmeaning that the models produce more informative time series for predicted\nfuture trends. A graph neural network (GNN) architecture was used to extract\nspatial dependencies, with different update functions to learn temporal\ncorrelations. These update functions were implemented using different neural\nnetwork architectures. One such architecture, the Transformer, has become\nincreasingly popular for sequence modelling in recent years. Various\nalterations have been proposed to better facilitate time series forecasting, of\nwhich this study focused on the Informer, LogSparse Transformer and Autoformer.\nThis is the first time the LogSparse Transformer and Autoformer have been\napplied to wind forecasting and the first time any of these or the Informer\nhave been formulated in a spatio-temporal setting for wind forecasting. By\ncomparing against spatio-temporal Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Multi-Layer\nPerceptron (MLP) models, the study showed that the models using the altered\nTransformer architectures as update functions in GNNs were able to outperform\nthese. Furthermore, we propose the Fast Fourier Transformer (FFTransformer),\nwhich is a novel Transformer architecture based on signal decomposition and\nconsists of two separate streams that analyse the trend and periodic components\nseparately. The FFTransformer and Autoformer were found to achieve superior\nresults for the 10-minute and 1-hour ahead forecasts, with the FFTransformer\nsignificantly outperforming all other models for the 4-hour ahead forecasts.\n",

When examining a\nmodel of opinion dynamics, it is beneficial to infer its parameters using\nempirical data. In this paper, we study an example of such an inference\nproblem. We consider a mean-field bounded-confidence model with an unknown\ninteraction kernel between individuals. This interaction kernel encodes how\nindividuals with different opinions interact and affect each other's opinions.\nIt is often difficult to quantitatively measure social opinions as empirical\ndata from observations or experiments, so we assume that the available data\ntakes the form of partial observations of the cumulative distribution function\nof opinions. We prove that certain measurements guarantee a precise and unique\ninference of the interaction kernel and propose a numerical method to\nreconstruct an interaction kernel from a limited number of data points. Our\nnumerical results suggest that the error of the inferred interaction kernel\ndecays exponentially as we strategically enlarge the data set.\n",

A priori estimates of\nplane-wave convergence for periodic Kohn-Sham calculations with\npseudopotentials have been proved , however in most computations in practice,\nplane-wave cut-offs are not tight enough to target the desired accuracy.

The computed\nenergy difference is believed to be much more accurate because of\n`discretization error cancellation', since the sources of numerical errors are\nessentially the same for different configurations. For periodic linear\nHamiltonians with Coulomb potentials, error cancellation can be explained by\nthe universality of the Kato cusp condition. Using weighted Sobolev spaces,\nTaylor-type expansions of the eigenfunctions are available yielding a precise\ncharacterization of this singularity. This then gives an explicit formula of\nthe first order term of the decay of the Fourier coefficients of the\neigenfunctions.

First, on spatial aspect, objects are locally compact and\nrelevant, thus fine-grained feature needs to be extracted from a token and its\nneighbors. While the lack of data hinders ViTs to attend the spatial relevance.\nSecond, on channel aspect, representation exhibits diversity on different\nchannels.

To this end, we propose Dynamic Hybrid\nVision Transformer (DHVT) as the solution to enhance the two inductive biases.\nOn spatial aspect, we adopt a hybrid structure, in which convolution is\nintegrated into patch embedding and multi-layer perceptron module, forcing the\nmodel to capture the token features as well as their neighboring features. On\nchannel aspect, we introduce a dynamic feature aggregation module in MLP and a\nbrand new \"head token\" design in multi-head self-attention module to help\nre-calibrate channel representation and make different channel group\nrepresentation interacts with each other. The fusion of weak channel\nrepresentation forms a strong enough representation for classification. With\nthis design, we successfully eliminate the performance gap between CNNs and\nViTs, and our DHVT achieves a series of state-of-the-art performance with a\nlightweight model, 85.68% on CIFAR-100 with 22.8M parameters, 82.3% on\nImageNet-1K with 24.0M parameters.

In this work, we\nsuitably invoke a family of $n$-settings Bell inequalities which is optimized\nfor $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ copies of maximally entangled two-qubit states,\nthereby, possess the ability to certify more randomness from many copies of\ntwo-qubit entangled state.\n",

In this paper, we perform a\ncomprehensive comparative analysis of existing group fairness metrics developed\nin the context of fair ranking. By virtue of their diverse application\ncontexts, we argue that such a comparative analysis is not straightforward.\nHence, we take an axiomatic approach whereby we design a set of thirteen\nproperties for group fairness metrics that consider different ranking settings.\nA metric can then be selected depending on whether it satisfies all or a subset\nof these properties. We apply these properties on eleven existing group\nfairness metrics, and through both empirical and theoretical results we\ndemonstrate that most of these metrics only satisfy a small subset of the\nproposed properties. These findings highlight limitations of existing metrics,\nand provide insights into how to evaluate and interpret different fairness\nmetrics in practical deployment. The proposed properties can also assist\npractitioners in selecting appropriate metrics for evaluating fairness in a\nspecific application.\n",

Recently, different adversarial training\ndefenses are proposed that not only maintain a high clean accuracy but also\nshow significant robustness against popular and well studied adversarial\nattacks such as PGD. High adversarial robustness can also arise if an attack\nfails to find adversarial gradient directions, a phenomenon known as `gradient\nmasking'. In this work, we analyse the effect of label smoothing on adversarial\ntraining as one of the potential causes of gradient masking. We then develop a\nguided mechanism to avoid local minima during attack optimization, leading to a\nnovel attack dubbed Guided Projected Gradient Attack (G-PGA). Our attack\napproach is based on a `match and deceive' loss that finds optimal adversarial\ndirections through guidance from a surrogate model. Our modified attack does\nnot require random restarts, large number of attack iterations or search for an\noptimal step-size. Furthermore, our proposed G-PGA is generic, thus it can be\ncombined with an ensemble attack strategy as we demonstrate for the case of\nAuto-Attack, leading to efficiency and convergence speed improvements. More\nthan an effective attack, G-PGA can be used as a diagnostic tool to reveal\nelusive robustness due to gradient masking in adversarial defenses.\n",

Recently, it is reported that few layers of Bi grown on\nsemiconductor substrate InSb(111)B exhibit the Sierpi\\'{n}ski-triangle (ST)\nfractal patterns on the surface. In this work, we have grown Bi layers on\nInSb(111)B and traced the evolution of the atomic and electronic structures of\nBi. The surface atomic structures and growth modes were monitored by using\nreflective high-energy electron diffraction and core-level photoelectron\nspectroscopy. It is suggested that the single layer of the ST-phase Bi grows on\nInSb(111)B and the following Bi deposition causes layer-by-layer growth up to\nnominally 4 atomic layers. Diffuse band dispersion and quantum well states\nobserved by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy are consistent with the\nsmall surface domains and variation of the thickness even during the\nlayer-by-layer growth region. The further Bi evaporation changes the growth\nmode to the 3D island formation. The unveiled growth behavior of Bi on\nInSb(111)B would provide a new interesting playground to study 2D topological\nelectronic structure of quasi-periodic 2D atomic layers.\n",

Currently, the transformer is\nmaking revolutionary progress in various vision tasks, leading to significant\nperformance improvements compared with the convolutional neural network (CNN)\nbased frameworks. In this paper, we conduct extensive research on exploiting\nthe contributions of transformers for accurate and reliable salient object\ndetection. For the former, we apply transformer to a deterministic model, and\nexplain that the effective structure modeling and global context modeling\nabilities lead to its superior performance compared with the CNN based\nframeworks. For the latter, we observe that both CNN and transformer based\nframeworks suffer greatly from the over-confidence issue, where the models tend\nto generate wrong predictions with high confidence. To estimate the reliability\ndegree of both CNN- and transformer-based frameworks, we further present a\nlatent variable model, namely inferential generative adversarial network\n(iGAN), based on the generative adversarial network (GAN). The stochastic\nattribute of the latent variable makes it convenient to estimate the predictive\nuncertainty, serving as an auxiliary output to evaluate the reliability of\nmodel prediction. Different from the conventional GAN, which defines the\ndistribution of the latent variable as fixed standard normal distribution\n$\\mathcal{N}(0,\\mathbf{I})$, the proposed iGAN infers the latent variable by\ngradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), namely Langevin dynamics,\nleading to an input-dependent latent variable model. We apply our proposed iGAN\nto both fully and weakly supervised salient object detection, and explain that\niGAN within the transformer framework leads to both accurate and reliable\nsalient object detection.\n",

This measurement revealed\na high angular momentum of the heavy ions and provided experimental evidence\nfor vorticity in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) for the first time. In order to\ninvestigate the underlying mechanisms, a dynamic description of the transfer of\nangular momentum is required. In this work, the microscopic non-equilibrium\ntransport approach SMASH (Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly-interacting\nHadrons) is applied to study the generation of global angular momentum by the\ninteraction of two nuclei. As SMASH provides access to the whole phase-space\nevolution of every particle at any given time, it allows to assess the fraction\nof angular momentum generated in the fireball by all participants. We confirm\nthe previous modeling by Becattini \\textit{et al} within a geometric Glauber\nmodel approach, which found that the angular momentum transfer reaches a unique\nmaximum in mid-central collisions during time evolution. The corresponding\nimpact parameter is around $b=4-6$ fm for all beam energies from $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm\nNN}}=2.41-200$ GeV. Even though angular momentum is not conserved locally in\nthe transport approach a priori, we identify the contributions to the\nconservation violation and propose optimal setups for different energy regimes\nthat recover conservation, based upon the test particle method and the\ntreatment of Fermi motion. Furthermore, the system size and centrality\ndependence are investigated.\n",

Methods: Optical coherence\ntomography angiography (OCTA) images of 30 eyes from 20 healthy controls, 21\neyes of diabetic patients with no DR (NoDR) and 26 eyes from 22 patients with\nmild non-proliferative DR (NPDR) were analyzed in this study. The OCTA images\nwere centered on the fovea and covered a 6 mm x 6 mm area. Enface projections\nof the superficial vascular plexus (SVP) and the deep capillary plexus (DCP)\nwere obtained for the quantitative OCTA feature analysis. Three quantitative\nOCTA features were examined: blood vessel density (BVD), blood flow flux (BFF),\nand normalized blood flow index (NBFI). Each feature was calculated from both\nthe SVP and DCP and their sensitivity to distinguish the three cohorts of the\nstudy were evaluated. Results: The only quantitative feature that was capable\nof distinguishing between all three cohorts was NBFI in the DCP image.\nComparative study revealed that both BVD and BFF were able to distinguish the\ncontrols from NoDR and mild NPDR. However, neither BVD nor BFF was sensitive\nenough to separate NoDR from the healthy controls. Conclusion: The NBFI has\nbeen demonstrated as a sensitive biomarker of early DR, revealing retinal blood\nflow abnormality better than traditional BVD and BFF. The NBFI in the DCP was\nverified as the most sensitive biomarker, supporting that diabetes affects the\nDCP earlier than SVP in DR.\n",

Despite the considerable progress, the\nexisting deep time series clustering approaches mostly seek to train the deep\nneural network by some instance reconstruction based or cluster distribution\nbased objective, which, however, lack the ability to exploit the sample-wise\n(or augmentation-wise) contrastive information or even the higher-level (e.g.,\ncluster-level) contrastiveness for learning discriminative and\nclustering-friendly representations. In light of this, this paper presents a\ndeep temporal contrastive clustering (DTCC) approach, which for the first time,\nto our knowledge, incorporates the contrastive learning paradigm into the deep\ntime series clustering research. Specifically, with two parallel views\ngenerated from the original time series and their augmentations, we utilize two\nidentical auto-encoders to learn the corresponding representations, and in the\nmeantime perform the cluster distribution learning by incorporating a k-means\nobjective. Further, two levels of contrastive learning are simultaneously\nenforced to capture the instance-level and cluster-level contrastive\ninformation, respectively. With the reconstruction loss of the auto-encoder,\nthe cluster distribution loss, and the two levels of contrastive losses jointly\noptimized, the network architecture is trained in a self-supervised manner and\nthe clustering result can thereby be obtained. Experiments on a variety of time\nseries datasets demonstrate the superiority of our DTCC approach over the\nstate-of-the-art.\n",

We propose to disentangle\nexplanations by finding relevant subspaces in activation space that can be\nmapped to more abstract human-understandable concepts and enable a joint\nattribution on concepts and input features. To automatically extract the\ndesired representation, we propose new subspace analysis formulations that\nextend the principle of PCA and subspace analysis to explanations.

This enables\na much stronger focus on subspaces that are truly relevant for the prediction\nand the explanation, in particular, ignoring activations or concepts to which\nthe prediction model is invariant.

Minimax\nrate-optimal estimators for such functionals are typically constructed through\nhigher-order bias corrections of plug-in and one-step type estimators and, in\nturn, depend on estimators of nuisance functions. In this paper, we consider a\nparallel question of interest regarding the optimality and/or sub-optimality of\nplug-in and one-step bias-corrected estimators for the specific doubly robust\nfunctional of interest. Specifically, we verify that by using undersmoothing\nand sample splitting techniques when constructing nuisance function estimators,\none can achieve minimax rates of convergence in all H\\\"older smoothness classes\nof the nuisance functions (i.e. the propensity score and outcome regression)\nprovided that the marginal density of the covariates is sufficiently regular.\nAdditionally, by demonstrating suitable lower bounds on these classes of\nestimators, we demonstrate the necessity to undersmooth the nuisance function\nestimators to obtain minimax optimal rates of convergence.\n",

In this paper, we briefly review the EMTR-based\nfault location method using direct convolution (EMTR-conv) and generalize it to\nmulti-phase transmission lines. Moreover, noting that the parameters of real\ntransmission lines are frequency-dependent, while constant-parameters were\noften used during the reverse process of EMTR-based methods in the previous\nstudies, we investigate the influence of this simplification to the fault\nlocation performance by considering frequency-dependent parameters and lossy\nground in the forward process which shows the location error increases as the\ndistance between the observation point and the fault position increases,\nespecially when the ground resistivity is high. Therefore, we propose a\ncorrection method to reduce the location error by using double observation\npoints. Numerical experiments are carried out in a 3-phase 300-km transmission\nline considering different ground resistivities, fault types and fault\nconditions, which shows the method gives good location errors and works\nefficiently via direct convolution of the signals collected from the fault and\nthe pre-stored calculated transient signals.\n",

Design tradeoffs include the\ngain-FOV tradeoff for each receiver element and the area-bandwidth tradeoff for\neach PD array.

The ADR performance is studied\nusing computer simulations and insightful design guidelines are provided\nthrough various numerical examples.

        "original_csv_abstract": "  We obtained mid-infrared spectra of chondrules, matrix, CAIs and bulk\nmaterial from primitive type 1-4 chondrites in order to compare them with the\ndust material in young, forming solar systems and around comets. Our aim is to\ninvestigate whether there are similarities between the first processed\nmaterials in our early Solar System and protoplanetary disks currently forming\naround other stars. Chondrule spectra can be divided into two groups. 1)\nChondrules dominated by olivine features at 11.3 micron and 10.0 micron. 2)\nmesostasis rich chondrules that show main features at 10 micron. Bulk ordinary\nchondrites show similar features to both groups. Fine-grained matrix is divided\ninto three groups. 1) phyllosilicate-rich with a main band at 10 micron, 2)\nolivine-rich with bands at 11.3 micron and 10 micron, 3) pyroxene rich. Impact\nshock processed matrix from Murchison (CM2) shows features from\nphyllosilicate-rich, amorphous and olivine rich material. Astronomical spectra\nare divided into four groups based on their spectral characteristics, amorphous\n(group 1), pyroxene rich (group 2), olivine rich (group 3) and complex (group\n4). Group 2 is similar to enstatite-rich fine grained material like e.g.\nKakangari (K3) matrix. Group 3 and 4 can be explained by a combination of\nvarying concentrations of olivine and mesostasis rich chondrules and fine\ngrained matrix, but also show very good agreement with shock processed\nmaterial. Comparison of band ratios confirms the similarity with chondritic\nmaterial e.g. for HD100546, while the inner disk of HD142527 show no sign of\nchondrule material. Comparison between spectra indicate a general similarity\nbetween primitive solar system materials and circumstellar dust and comets.\n",

The low 30 ml volume of the\nsource makes it easy to fill and place, and the method does not use prior image\ndata or attenuation map assumptions. Our supplemental transmission aided\nmaximum likelihood reconstruction of attenuation and activity (sTX-MLAA)\nalgorithm contains an attenuation map update that maximizes the likelihood of\nterms representing coincidences originating from tracer in the patient and a\nweighted expression of counts segmented from the external source alone. Both\nexternal source and patient scatter and randoms are fully corrected. We\nevaluated performance of sTX-MLAA compared to reference standard CT-based AC\nwith FDG PET/CT phantom studies; including modeling a patient with myocardial\ninflammation. Through an ROI analysis we measured less than 5% bias in activity\nconcentrations for PET images generated with sTX-MLAA relative to CT-AC. PET\nbackground variability (from noise and sparse sampling) was substantially\nreduced with sTX-MLAA compared to using coincidences segmented from the\ntransmission source alone for AC.

Motivated by the\ngroundbreaking potentials of liquid antennas, researchers in the wireless\ncommunication community are investigating a novel antenna system where a single\nantenna can freely switch positions along a small linear space to pick the\nstrongest received signal. However, the FAS positions do not necessarily follow\nthe ever-existing rule separating them by at least half the radiation\nwavelength. Previous work in the literature parameterized the channels of the\nFAS ports simply enough to provide a single-integral expression of the\nprobability of outage and various insights on the achievable performance.\nNevertheless, this channel model may not accurately capture the correlation\nbetween the ports, given by Jake's model. This work builds on the\nstate-of-the-art and accurately approximates the FAS channel while maintaining\nanalytical tractability. The approximation is performed in two stages. The\nfirst stage approximation considerably reduces the number of multi-fold\nintegrals in the probability of outage expression, while the second stage\napproximation provides a single integral representation of the FAS probability\nof outage. Further, the performance of such innovative technology is\ninvestigated under a less-idealized correlation model. Numerical results\nvalidate our approximations of the FAS channel model and demonstrate a limited\nperformance gain under realistic assumptions. Further, our work opens the door\nfor future research to investigate scenarios in which the FAS provides a\nperformance gain compared to the current multiple antennas solutions.\n",

The importance of inertia then dictates\nthat both position and momentum must, in principle, be known to fully describe\nthe system, which makes its quantitative experimental characterization rather\nchallenging. We introduce a general method of Bayesian inference of the force\nfield and environmental parameters in stochastic inertial systems that operates\nsolely on the time series of recorded noisy positions of the system. The method\nis first validated on simulated trajectories of model stochastic harmonic and\nanharmonic oscillators with damping. Subsequently, the method is applied to\nexperimental trajectories of particles levitating in tailored optical fields\nand used to characterize the dynamics of particle motion in a nonlinear Duffing\npotential, a static or time-dependent double-well potential, and a\nnon-conservative force field. The presented inference procedure does not make\nany simplifying assumptions about the nature or symmetry of the acting force\nfield and provides robust results with trajectories two orders of magnitude\nshorter than those typically required by alternative inference schemes. In\naddition to being a powerful tool for quantitative data analysis, it can also\nguide experimentalists in choosing appropriate sampling frequency (at least 20\nmeasured points per single characteristic period) and length of the measured\ntrajectories (at least 10 periods) to estimate the force field and\nenvironmental characteristics with a desired accuracy and precision.\n",

Thus, developing deactivated\nvirus constructs or safe-to-use virus-like objects, which imitate real viruses\nand allow performing virus-related studies in any research laboratory,\nconstitutes an important scientific challenge. One of the groups of such\nspecies are the so-called virus-like particles (VLPs). Instead of capsids with\nviral DNA/RNA, VLPs have synthetic cores with real virus proteins attached to\nthem. We have developed a method for the preparation of VLPs imitating the\nvirus responsible for the COVID-19 disease: the SARS-CoV-2. The particles have\nAu cores surrounded by \"coronas\" of S1 domains of the virus's Spike protein.\nImportantly, they are safe to use and specifically interact with SARS-CoV-2\nantibodies. Moreover, Au cores exhibit localized surface plasmon resonance\n(LSPR), which makes the synthesized VLPs suitable for biosensing applications.\nWithin our studies, the effect allowed us to visualize the interaction between\nthe VLPs and the antibodies and identify the characteristic vibrational\nsignals. What is more, additional functionalization of the particles with a\nfluorescent label revealed their potential in studying specific virus-related\ninteractions. Notably, the universal character of the developed synthesis\nmethod makes it potentially applicable for fabricating VLPs imitating other\nlife-threatening viruses.\n",

Our main finding is that the\nnormal-state bulk Dirac nodes, usually ignored in TI-based vortex Majorana\ntheories for tFeSCs, will play a key role of determining the vortex state\ntopology. In particular, the interplay between TI and Dirac nodal bands will\nlead to multiple competing topological phases for a superconducting vortex line\nin tFeSCs, including an unprecedented hybrid topological vortex state that\ncarries both Majorana bound states and a gapless dispersion. Remarkably, this\nexotic hybrid vortex phase generally exists in the vortex phase diagram for our\nminimal model for tFeSCs and is directly relevant to tFeSC candidates such as\nLiFeAs.When the four-fold rotation symmetry is broken by vortex-line tilting or\ncurving, the hybrid vortex gets topologically trivialized and becomes\nMajorana-free, which could explain the puzzle of ubiquitous trivial vortices\nobserved in LiFeAs.

Nevertheless, these have proved vulnerable to small\nadversarial input perturbations. A number of approaches for improving or\ncertifying robustness of end-to-end RL to adversarial perturbations have\nemerged as a result, focusing on cumulative reward. However, what is often at\nstake in adversarial scenarios is the violation of fundamental properties, such\nas safety, rather than the overall reward that combines safety with efficiency.\nMoreover, properties such as safety can only be defined with respect to true\nstate, rather than the high-dimensional raw inputs to end-to-end policies. To\ndisentangle nominal efficiency and adversarial safety, we situate RL in\ndeterministic partially-observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) with the\ngoal of maximizing cumulative reward subject to safety constraints. We then\npropose a partially-supervised reinforcement learning (PSRL) framework that\ntakes advantage of an additional assumption that the true state of the POMDP is\nknown at training time. We present the first approach for certifying safety of\nPSRL policies under adversarial input perturbations, and two adversarial\ntraining approaches that make direct use of PSRL.

One key mechanism, how\nbistability arises under parameter variation is a pitchfork bifurcation. In\nparticular, taking the pitchfork bifurcation normal form for reaction-diffusion\nPDEs is yet another variant within the family of PDEs mentioned above.

Our generalisation is\nmotivated directly by applications as we introduce in the equation a spatially\nheterogeneous term and relax the assumptions on the covariance operator that\ndefines the noise. For this spatially heterogeneous SPDE, we prove a\nfinite-time Lyapunov exponent bifurcation result. Furthermore, we extend the\ntheory of early warning signs in our context and we explain, the role of\nuniversal exponents between covariance operator warning signs and the lack of\nfinite-time Lyapunov uniformity.

        "original_csv_abstract": "  Video Super-Resolution (VSR) aims to restore high-resolution (HR) videos from\nlow-resolution (LR) videos. Existing VSR techniques usually recover HR frames\nby extracting pertinent textures from nearby frames with known degradation\nprocesses. Despite significant progress, grand challenges are remained to\neffectively extract and transmit high-quality textures from high-degraded\nlow-quality sequences, such as blur, additive noises, and compression\nartifacts. In this work, a novel Frequency-Transformer (FTVSR) is proposed for\nhandling low-quality videos that carry out self-attention in a combined\nspace-time-frequency domain. First, video frames are split into patches and\neach patch is transformed into spectral maps in which each channel represents a\nfrequency band. It permits a fine-grained self-attention on each frequency\nband, so that real visual texture can be distinguished from artifacts. Second,\na novel dual frequency attention (DFA) mechanism is proposed to capture the\nglobal frequency relations and local frequency relations, which can handle\ndifferent complicated degradation processes in real-world scenarios. Third, we\nexplore different self-attention schemes for video processing in the frequency\ndomain and discover that a ``divided attention'' which conducts a joint\nspace-frequency attention before applying temporal-frequency attention, leads\nto the best video enhancement quality. Extensive experiments on three\nwidely-used VSR datasets show that FTVSR outperforms state-of-the-art methods\non different low-quality videos with clear visual margins. Code and pre-trained\nmodels are available at https://github.com/researchmm/FTVSR.\n",

Despite the potential for predictive analytics,\ntwo major barriers exist to their adoption in higher education: (a) the lack of\ndemocratization in deployment, and (b) the potential to exacerbate\ninequalities. Education researchers and policymakers encounter numerous\nchallenges in deploying predictive modeling in practice. These challenges\npresent in different steps of modeling including data preparation, model\ndevelopment, and evaluation. Nevertheless, each of these steps can introduce\nadditional bias to the system if not appropriately performed. Most large-scale\nand nationally representative education data sets suffer from a significant\nnumber of incomplete responses from the research participants. While many\neducation-related studies addressed the challenges of missing data, little is\nknown about the impact of handling missing values on the fairness of predictive\noutcomes in practice. In this paper, we set out to first assess the disparities\nin predictive modeling outcomes for college-student success, then investigate\nthe impact of imputation techniques on the model performance and fairness using\na commonly used set of metrics. We conduct a prospective evaluation to provide\na less biased estimation of future performance and fairness than an evaluation\nof historical data. Our comprehensive analysis of a real large-scale education\ndataset reveals key insights on modeling disparities and how imputation\ntechniques impact the fairness of the student-success predictive outcome under\ndifferent testing scenarios.

Therefore, this paper attempts to develop a generalized\ntheory for the design of the stabilizing feedback law wherever possible for a\ngeneral class of systems, including the systems in standard structured and\nunstructured forms discussed in the existing literature. The theory behind this\ngeneral controller design theory utilizes the idea of an invariant target\nmanifold giving rise to a non-degenerate two form, through which the definition\nof certain passive outputs and storage functions leads to a generation of\ncontrol law for stabilizing the system. Because the above concepts are linked\nwith the Immersion and Invariance (I&I) design policy and the passivity theory\nof controller design, the proposed methodology is labeled as the \"Passivity and\nImmersion (P&I) approach\". Furthermore, being a constructive methodology, the\nvarious worked examples in this paper exemplify and demonstrate the various\ndesign paradigms such as Backstepping, Incremental Backstepping, Forwarding,\nI&I, and the techniques based on the generation of Control Contraction Metrics\n(CCM) can be unified in the P&I methodology.\n",

The\nCO$_2$-CH$_4$ pair in particular is theorized to be a potential biosignature\nwhen inferred to be in chemical disequilibrium. Here, we simulate TRAPPIST-1e's\natmosphere using the ExoCAM General Circulation Model (GCM), assuming an\noptimistic haze-free, tidally locked planet with an aquaplanet surface, with\nvarying atmospheric compositions from $10^{-4}$ bar to 1 bar of partial CO$_2$\npressure with 1 bar of background N$_2$. We investigate cases both with and\nwithout a modern Earth-like CH$_4$ mixing ratio to examine the effect of CO$_2$\nand CH$_4$ on the transmission spectrum and climate state of the planet. We\ndemonstrate that in the optimistic haze-free cloudy case, H$_2$O, CO$_2$, and\nCH$_4$ could all be detectable in less than 50 transits within an atmosphere of\n1 bar N$_2$ and 10 mbar CO$_2$ during JWST's lifespan with NIRSpec as long as\nthe noise floor is $\\lesssim$ 10 ppm. We find that in these optimistic cases,\nJWST may be able to detect potential biosignature pairs such as CO$_2$-CH$_4$\nin TRAPPIST-1e's atmosphere across a variety of atmospheric CO$_2$ content, and\nthat temporal climate variability does not significantly affect spectral\nfeature variability for NIRSpec PRISM.\n",

As a result,\nautomated debugging techniques including Fault Localization (FL) and Automated\nProgram Repair (APR) have garnered significant attention due to their potential\nto aid developers in debugging tasks. Despite intensive research on these\nsubjects, we are unaware of a theoretic framework that highlights the\nprinciples behind automated debugging and allows abstract analysis of\ntechniques. Such a framework would heighten our understanding of the endeavor\nand provide a way to formally analyze techniques and approaches. To this end,\nwe first propose a Bayesian framework of understanding automated repair and\nfind that in conjunction with a concrete statement of the objective of\nautomated debugging, we can recover maximal fault localization formulae from\nprior work, as well as analyze existing APR techniques and their underlying\nassumptions.\n  As a means of empirically demonstrating our framework, we further propose\nBAPP, a Bayesian Patch Prioritization technique that incorporates intermediate\nprogram values to analyze likely patch locations and repair actions, with its\ncore equations being derived by our Bayesian framework. We find that\nincorporating program values allows BAPP to identify correct patches more\nprecisely: when applied to the patches generated by kPAR, the rankings produced\nby BAPP reduce the number of required patch validation by 68% and consequently\nreduce the repair time by 34 minutes on average. Further, BAPP improves the\nprecision of FL, increasing acc@5 on the studied bugs from 8 to 11. These\nresults highlight the potential of value-cognizant automated debugging\ntechniques, and further validates our theoretical framework. Finally, future\ndirections that the framework suggests are provided.\n",

However, private verification approaches\ndo not allow model users to verify the model at run-time. Instead, they must\ntrust the service provider, who may tamper with the verification results. In\ncontrast, a public verification approach that considers the possibility of\ndishonest service providers can benefit a wider range of users. In this paper,\nwe propose PublicCheck, a practical public integrity verification solution for\nservices of run-time deep models. PublicCheck considers dishonest service\nproviders, and overcomes public verification challenges of being lightweight,\nproviding anti-counterfeiting protection, and having fingerprinting samples\nthat appear smooth. To capture and fingerprint the inherent prediction\nbehaviors of a run-time model, PublicCheck generates smoothly transformed and\naugmented encysted samples that are enclosed around the model's decision\nboundary while ensuring that the verification queries are indistinguishable\nfrom normal queries. PublicCheck is also applicable when knowledge of the\ntarget model is limited (e.g., with no knowledge of gradients or model\nparameters). A thorough evaluation of PublicCheck demonstrates the strong\ncapability for model integrity breach detection (100% detection accuracy with\nless than 10 black-box API queries) against various model integrity attacks and\nmodel compression attacks. PublicCheck also demonstrates the smooth appearance,\nfeasibility, and efficiency of generating a plethora of encysted samples for\nfingerprinting.\n",

A candidate adaptive feedback design\nis also proposed in the case of scalar problems with unmodeled nonlinearities.\nIn the former case, rigorous analysis shows guaranteed performance bounds for\nthe associated prediction and estimation errors. Together with an assumption of\npersistent excitation, there follows asymptotic convergence to periodic\nresponses determined uniquely by an a priori unknown periodic reference input\nand independent of initial conditions, as required by the control-based\ncontinuation paradigm. In particular, when the reference input equals the\nsought periodic response, the steady-state control input vanishes. Identical\nconclusions follow for the case of scalar dynamics with unmodeled\nnonlinearities, albeit with slow rates of convergence. Numerical simulations\nvalidate the theoretical predictions for individual parameter values.\nIntegration with the software package COCO demonstrate successful continuation\nalong families of stable and unstable periodic orbits with a minimum of\nparameter tuning.

GREAT3 was divided into experiments to test three\nspecific questions, and included simulated space- and ground-based data with\nconstant or cosmologically-varying shear fields. The simplest (control)\nexperiment included parametric galaxies with a realistic distribution of\nsignal-to-noise, size, and ellipticity, and a complex point spread function\n(PSF). The other experiments tested the additional impact of realistic galaxy\nmorphology, multiple exposure imaging, and the uncertainty about a\nspatially-varying PSF; the last two questions will be explored in Paper II. The\n24 participating teams competed to estimate lensing shears to within systematic\nerror tolerances for upcoming Stage-IV dark energy surveys, making 1525\nsubmissions overall. GREAT3 saw considerable variety and innovation in the\ntypes of methods applied. Several teams now meet or exceed the targets in many\nof the tests conducted (to within the statistical errors). We conclude that the\npresence of realistic galaxy morphology in simulations changes shear\ncalibration biases by $\\sim 1$ per cent for a wide range of methods. Other\neffects such as truncation biases due to finite galaxy postage stamps, and the\nimpact of galaxy type as measured by the S\\'{e}rsic index, are quantified for\nthe first time. Our results generalize previous studies regarding sensitivities\nto galaxy size and signal-to-noise, and to PSF properties such as seeing and\ndefocus. Almost all methods' results support the simple model in which additive\nshear biases depend linearly on PSF ellipticity.\n",

Predicting the lifestyle of phages helps\ndecipher their interactions with their bacterial hosts, aiding phages'\napplications in fields such as phage therapy. Because experimental methods for\nannotating the lifestyle of phages cannot keep pace with the fast accumulation\nof sequenced phages, computational method for predicting phages' lifestyles has\nbecome an attractive alternative. Despite some promising results, computational\nlifestyle prediction remains difficult because of the limited known annotations\nand the sheer amount of sequenced phage contigs assembled from metagenomic\ndata. In particular, most of the existing tools cannot precisely predict\nphages' lifestyles for short contigs. In this work, we develop PhaTYP (Phage\nTYPe prediction tool) to improve the accuracy of lifestyle prediction on short\ncontigs. We design two different training tasks, self-supervised and\nfine-tuning tasks, to overcome lifestyle prediction difficulties. We rigorously\ntested and compared PhaTYP with four state-of-the-art methods: DeePhage,\nPHACTS, PhagePred, and BACPHLIP. The experimental results show that PhaTYP\noutperforms all these methods and achieves more stable performance on short\ncontigs. In addition, we demonstrated the utility of PhaTYP for analyzing the\nphage lifestyle on human neonates' gut data. This application shows that PhaTYP\nis a useful means for studying phages in metagenomic data and helps extend our\nunderstanding of microbial communities.\n",

To enable\nthis capability, the necessity of considering an integrated vertical\nheterogeneous network (VHetNet) architecture appears to be inevitable due to\nits high inherent agility.

Predicting the hosts of prokaryotic viruses helps\ndecipher the dynamic relationship between microbes. Experimental methods for\nhost prediction cannot keep pace with the fast accumulation of sequenced\nphages. Thus, there is a need for computational host prediction. Despite some\npromising results, computational host prediction remains a challenge because of\nthe limited known interactions and the sheer amount of sequenced phages by\nhigh-throughput sequencing technologies. The state-of-the-art methods can only\nachieve 43\\% accuracy at the species level.

Our implementation named CHERRY can be\napplied to predict hosts for newly discovered viruses and to identify viruses\ninfecting targeted bacteria. We demonstrated the utility of CHERRY for both\napplications and compared its performance with 11 popular host prediction\nmethods.

Those NEPv commonly arise as\nthe first-order optimality conditions of a particular type of optimization\nproblems over the Stiefel manifold, and previously, special cases have been\nstudied in the literature. Two necessary conditions, a definiteness condition\nand a rank-preserving condition, on an eigenbasis matrix of the NEPv that is a\nglobal optimizer of the associated problem optimization are revealed, where the\ndefiniteness condition has been known for the special cases previously\ninvestigated. We show that, locally close to the eigenbasis matrix satisfying\nboth necessary conditions, the NEPv can be reformulated as a unitarily\ninvariant NEPv, the so-called aligned NEPv, through a basis alignment operation\n-- in other words, the NEPv is locally unitarily invariantizable. Numerically,\nthe NEPv is naturally solved by an SCF-type iteration. By exploiting the\ndifferentiability of the coefficient matrix of the aligned NEPv, we establish a\nclosed-form local convergence rate for the SCF-type iteration and analyze its\nlevel-shifted variant.

However,\nexisting solutions for centralized power control may require full channel state\ninformation (CSI) of all the desired and interfering links, which may be\ncumbersome and time-consuming to obtain in dense deployments. This paper\npresents a novel solution for centralized power control for industrial\nsubnetworks based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The proposed method only\nrequires the subnetwork positioning information, usually known at the central\ncontroller, and the knowledge of the desired link channel gain during the\nexecution phase. Simulation results show that our solution achieves similar\nspectral efficiency as the benchmark schemes requiring full CSI in runtime\noperations. Also, robustness to changes in the deployment density and\nenvironment characteristics with respect to the training phase is verified.\n",

As a predictive coding model, it is updated by a combination of\nbottom-up and top-down information flows, which is different from traditional\nbottom-up training style. Its advantage is to reduce the dependence on input\ninformation and improve its ability to predict and generate images.\nImportantly, we achieve with a multi-scale approach -- higher level neurons\ngenerate coarser predictions (lower resolution), while the lower level generate\nfiner predictions (higher resolution). This is different from the traditional\npredictive coding framework in which higher level predict the activity of\nneurons in lower level. To improve the predictive ability, we integrate an\nencoder-decoder network in the LSTM architecture and share the final encoded\nhigh-level semantic information between different levels. Additionally, since\nthe output of each network level is an RGB image, a smaller LSTM hidden state\ncan be used to retain and update the only necessary hidden information,\navoiding being mapped to an overly discrete and complex space. In this way, we\ncan reduce the difficulty of prediction and the computational overhead.\nFinally, we further explore the training strategies, to address the instability\nin adversarial training and mismatch between training and testing in long-term\nprediction.

Often simplistic models, such as those derived from geometric constraints, capture bulk real-world 3D protein-protein properties well. One approach is using protein contact maps to better understand proteins' properties. Here, we investigate the emergent behaviour of contact maps for different geometrically constrained models and real-world protein systems. We …",

The Berge--Fulkerson Conjecture (1970s)\nstates that $G$ admits a list of six perfect matchings such that each edge of\n$G$ belongs to exactly two of these perfect matchings. If answered in the\naffirmative, two other recent conjectures would also be true: the Fan--Raspaud\nConjecture (1994), which states that $G$ admits three perfect matchings such\nthat every edge of $G$ belongs to at most two of them; and a conjecture by\nMazzuoccolo (2013), which states that $G$ admits two perfect matchings whose\ndeletion yields a bipartite subgraph of $G$. It can be shown that given an\narbitrary perfect matching of $G$, it is not always possible to extend it to a\nlist of three or six perfect matchings satisfying the statements of the\nFan--Raspaud and the Berge--Fulkerson conjectures, respectively. In this paper,\nwe show that given any $1^+$-factor $F$ (a spanning subgraph of $G$ such that\nits vertices have degree at least 1) and an arbitrary edge $e$ of $G$, there\nalways exists a perfect matching $M$ of $G$ containing $e$ such that\n$G\\setminus (F\\cup M)$ is bipartite.

        "original_csv_abstract": "  In today's online advertising markets, an important demand for an advertiser\n(buyer) is to control her total expenditure within a time span under some\nbudget. Among all budget control approaches, throttling stands out as a popular\none, where the buyer participates in only a part of auctions. This paper gives\na theoretical panorama of a single buyer's dynamic budget throttling process in\nrepeated second-price auctions, which is lacking in the literature. We first\nestablish a lower bound on the regret and an upper bound on the asymptotic\ncompetitive ratio for any throttling algorithm, respectively, on whether the\nbuyer's values are stochastic or adversarial. Second, on the algorithmic side,\nwe consider two different information structures, with increasing difficulty in\nlearning the stochastic distribution of the highest competing bid. We further\npropose the OGD-CB algorithm, which is oblivious to stochastic or adversarial\nvalues and has asymptotically equal results under these two information\nstructures. Specifically, with stochastic values, we demonstrate that this\nalgorithm guarantees a near-optimal expected regret. When values are\nadversarial, we prove that the proposed algorithm reaches the upper bound on\nthe asymptotic competitive ratio. At last, we compare throttling with pacing,\nanother widely adopted budget control method, in repeated second-price\nauctions. In the stochastic case, we illustrate that pacing is generally better\nthan throttling for the buyer, which is an extension of known results that\npacing is asymptotically optimal in this scenario. However, in the adversarial\ncase, we give an exciting result indicating that throttling is the\nasymptotically optimal dynamic bidding strategy. Our results fill the gaps in\nthe theoretical research of throttling in repeated auctions and comprehensively\nreveal the ability of this popular budget-smoothing strategy.\n",

We also provide strong numerical evidences that for\nlarge next-nearest-neighbor repulsion the transition belongs to the\nPokrovsky-Talapov univerality class describing a non-conformal\ncommensurate-incommensurate transition. Finally, we argue that the change of\nthe nature of the transition is a result of incommensurability induced by\nfrustration and realized even at zero doping. The implications in the context\nof XXZ chain with next-nearest-neighbor Ising interaction is briefly discussed.\n",

The utility of an intensifier was\ninvestigated for its effect on image quality including signal to noise and\nspatial resolution. Pulse by pulse variability in Cherenkov emission profile\nwere quantified spatially and temporally.\n  Main results: An intensifier improved the emission profile signal to noise\nratio from 15 to 280, with reduced spatial resolution.

The new approach differs from existing $C^1$ perturbation\napproach and spectral approach, and can handle the high regularity, high\ndimensional cases and even Riemannian metric perturbations. Moreover, the proof\nis constructive and effective. We apply the method to the original nearly\nintegrable setting of Poincar\\'e and confirm several old and new conjectures\nwith weak formulations. First, for Poincar\\'e's original setting of nearly\nintegrable systems, we prove that for typical perturbations, periodic orbits\nare asymptotically dense as the size of perturbation tends to zero. Second, we\nprove that typical smooth perturbation of the geodesic flow on the flat torus\nhas asymptotically dense periodic orbits, which partially solves an open\nproblem since Pugh-Robinson's $C^1$-closing lemma.

This masking operation neutralizes the adversarial\neffect and allows any vanilla object detector to safely detect objects on the\nmasked images.

In this\npaper, we remove Legendre functions usually used in the fast multipole method\nand instead use charges fixed in positions. As an application of this method,\nwe remove the discontinuity. It also leads us to a method of periodic boundary\ncondition that is continuous even if a particle goes out from a wall of a\nsimulation box and enters in opposite side of the box.

        "original_csv_abstract": "  A vertex coloring of a graph $G$ is called distinguishing if no non-identity\nautomorphisms of $G$ can preserve it. The distinguishing number of $G$, denoted\nby $D(G)$, is the minimum number of colors required for such a coloring, and\nthe distinguishing threshold of $G$, denoted by $\\theta(G)$, is the minimum\nnumber $k$ such that every $k$-coloring of $G$ is distinguishing. As an\nalternative definition, $\\theta(G)$ is one more than the maximum number of\ncycles in the cycle decomposition of automorphisms of $G$. In this paper, we\ncharacterize $\\theta (G)$ when $G$ is disconnected. Afterwards, we prove that,\nalthough for every positive integer $k\\neq 2$ there are infinitely many graphs\nwhose distinguishing thresholds are equal to $k$, we have $\\theta(G)=2$ if and\nonly if $\\vert V(G)\\vert =2$. Moreover, we show that if $\\theta(G)=3$, then\neither $G$ is isomorphic to one of the four graphs on~3 vertices or it is of\norder $2p$, where $p\\neq 3,5$ is a prime number. Furthermore, we prove that\n$\\theta(G)=D(G)$ if and only if $G$ is asymmetric, $K_n$ or $\\overline{K_n}$.\nFinally, we consider all generalized Johnson graphs, $J(n,k,i)$, which are the\ngraphs on all $k$-subsets of $\\{1,\\ldots , n\\}$ where two vertices $A$ and $B$\nare adjacent if $|A\\cap B|=k-i$. After studying their automorphism groups and\ndistinguishing numbers, we calculate their distinguishing thresholds as\n$\\theta(J(n,k,i))={n\\choose k} - {n-2\\choose k-1}+1$, unless $ k=\\frac{n}{2}$\nand $i\\in\\{ \\frac{k}{2} , k\\}$ in which case we have\n$\\theta(J(n,k,i))={n\\choose k}$.\n",

        "original_csv_abstract": "  Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) improve the throughput of\nintersections by crossing in a lane-free order as compared to the signalised\ncrossing of human drivers. However, it is challenging to quantify such an\nimprovement because the available frameworks to analyse the capacity (i.e., the\nmaximum throughput) of the conventional intersections does not apply to the\nlane-free ones. This paper proposes a novel theoretical framework to\nnumerically simulate and compare the capacity of lane-free and conventional\nintersections. The results show that the maximum number of vehicles passing\nthrough a lane-free intersection is up to seven times more than a signalised\nintersection managed by the state-of-the-art max-pressure and Webster\nalgorithms. A sensitivity analysis shows that, in contrast to the signalised\nintersections, the capacity of the lane-free intersections improves by an\nincrease in initial speed, the maximum permissible speed and acceleration of\nvehicles.\n",

Furthermore, we introduce\nthe incremental leaning mechanisms to develop an alternative iterative\nalgorithm, where the feature selection matrix is incrementally updated, rather\nthan recomputing on the entire updated data from scratch. A series of\nexperiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method by\ncomparing with several state-of-the-art methods.

The motivation for such a model originates from real-world observational\ndata, which often contain groups of samples obtained under heterogeneous\nconditions in space and time, potentially resulting in differences in network\nstructure among groups. Therefore, the i.i.d. assumption is unrealistic, and\nfitting a single graphical model on all data results in a network that does not\naccurately represent the between group differences. In addition, real-world\nobservational data is typically of mixed discrete-and-continuous type,\nviolating the Gaussian assumption that is typical of graphical models, which\nleads to the model being unable to adequately recover the underlying graph\nstructure. The proposed model takes into account these properties of data, by\ntreating observed data as transformed latent Gaussian data, by means of the\nGaussian copula, and thereby allowing for the attractive properties of the\nGaussian distribution such as estimating the optimal number of model parameter\nusing the inverse covariance matrix. The multi-group setting is addressed by\njointly fitting a graphical model for each group, and applying the fused group\npenalty to fuse similar graphs together. In an extensive simulation study, the\nproposed model is evaluated against alternative models, where the proposed\nmodel is better able to recover the true underlying graph structure for\ndifferent groups. Finally, the proposed model is applied on real\nproduction-ecological data pertaining to on-farm maize yield in order to\nshowcase the added value of the proposed method in generating new hypotheses\nfor production ecologists.\n",

Faults and cyber attacks have been shown to cause safety\nviolations, which can damage the system and endanger human lives. Resilient\narchitectures have been proposed to ensure safety of CPS under such faults and\nattacks via methodologies including redundancy and restarting from safe\noperating conditions. The existing resilient architectures for CPS utilize\ndifferent mechanisms to guarantee safety, and currently there is no approach to\ncompare them. Moreover, the analysis and design undertaken for CPS employing\none architecture is not readily extendable to another. In this paper, we\npropose a timing-based framework for CPS employing various resilient\narchitectures and develop a common methodology for safety analysis and\ncomputation of control policies and design parameters. Using the insight that\nthe cyber subsystem operates in one out of a finite number of statuses, we\nfirst develop a hybrid system model that captures CPS adopting any of these\narchitectures. Based on the hybrid system, we formulate the problem of joint\ncomputation of control policies and associated timing parameters for CPS to\nsatisfy a given safety constraint and derive sufficient conditions for the\nsolution. Utilizing the derived conditions, we provide an algorithm to compute\ncontrol policies and timing parameters relevant to the employed architecture.\nWe also note that our solution can be applied to a wide class of CPS with\npolynomial dynamics and also allows incorporation of new architectures. We\nverify our proposed framework by performing a case study on adaptive cruise\ncontrol of vehicles.\n",

Our method is based on the\nprinciple of quantum interference. We use two identical sources of a two-photon\nmixed state and generate a set of single-photon interference patterns. The\nentanglement of the two-photon quantum state is characterized by the visibility\nof the interference patterns. Our experiment thus opens up a distinct avenue\nfor verifying and measuring entanglement, and can allow for mixed state\nentanglement characterization even when one particle in the pair cannot be\ndetected.\n",

In this paper, we present some particular examples in which the\ntail of the distribution becomes highly non-Gaussian although the statistics\nremains almost Gaussian in the perturbative regime. We begin with an extension\nof the ultra-slow-roll inflation that incorporates a transition process, where\nthe inflaton climbs up a tiny potential step at the end of the non-attractor\nstage before it converges to the slow-roll attractor. Through this example, we\nidentify the key role of the off-attractor behaviour for the upward-step\ntransition, and then extend the analysis to another type of the transition with\ntwo slow-roll stages connected by a tiny step. We perform both the perturbative\nand non-perturbative analyses of primordial fluctuations generated around the\nstep in detail, and show that the tiny but nontrivial transition may affect\nlarge perturbations in the tail of the distribution, while the perturbative\nnon-Gaussianity remains small. Our result indicates that the non-Gaussian tails\ncan have rich phenomenology which has been overlooked in conventional analyses.\nWe also study the implications of this non-Gaussian tail for the formation of\nprimordial black holes, and find that their mass fraction can be parametrically\namplified by several orders of magnitudes in comparison with the case of the\nGaussian distribution. Additionally, we also discuss a mechanism of primordial\nblack holes formation for this upward step inflation model by trapping the\ninflaton in the bottom of the step.\n",

In the first\ncase, the inflaton still moves backwards on the effective potential during\ninflation, while in the second, it does not, meaning that this behavior comes\nfrom the dark charge. We connect the model with hyperinflationary models and\ninvestigate how the different epochs are born from the interplay between the\ntwo scalar fields. We demonstrate that there is a dynamically induced slow-roll\nepoch, which is prolonged by the complicated movement of the two scalars in the\nfield space. Finally, we show that while the adiabatic speed of sound can\nbecome imaginary, the phase speed of sound remains real.\n",

In this technique, the light\npattern of the object is superimposed with a correlated auxiliary pattern, the\nfunction of which is to reverse the adverse effect of noise and random\ndistortion based on their spectral characteristics. Despite enormous\nimplications in statistics, an experimental realization of this novel technique\nhas been lacking to date. Here, we present the first experimental\ndemonstration.

For example, we prove an unconditional lower bound of\n$\\Omega((n/k) \\log n)$ on the stationary cover time, holding for any $n$-vertex\ngraph $G$ and any $1 \\leq k =o(n\\log n )$. Secondly, we establish the\nstationary cover times of multiple walks on several fundamental networks up to\nconstant factors. Thirdly, we present a framework characterising worst-case\ncover times in terms of stationary cover times and a novel, relaxed notion of\nmixing time for multiple walks called the partial mixing time. Roughly\nspeaking, the partial mixing time only requires a specific portion of all\nrandom walks to be mixed.

However,\nwhen Re-ID models are directly deployed in a new domain without target samples,\nthey always suffer from considerable performance degradation and poor domain\ngeneralization. To address this challenge, we propose a Deep Multimodal Fusion\nnetwork to elaborate rich semantic knowledge for assisting in representation\nlearning during the pre-training. Importantly, a multimodal fusion strategy is\nintroduced to translate the features of different modalities into the common\nspace, which can significantly boost generalization capability of Re-ID model.\nAs for the fine-tuning stage, a realistic dataset is adopted to fine-tune the\npre-trained model for better distribution alignment with real-world data.\nComprehensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method can\nsignificantly outperform previous domain generalization or meta-learning\nmethods with a clear margin.

This\nwork investigates metallic alloys comprised of several bioactive metals with\nthe target of achieving broad-spectrum, rapid bioactivity through synergistic\nactivity. An entropy-motivated stabilization paradigm is proposed to prepare\nscalable alloys of copper, silver, nickel and cobalt. Using combinatorial\nsputtering, thin-film alloys were prepared on 100 mm wafers with 50%\ncompositional grading of each element across the wafer. The films were then\nannealed and investigated for alloy stability. Bioactivity testing was\nperformed on both the as-grown alloys and the annealed films using four\nmicroorganisms -- Phi6, MS2, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli -- as\nsurrogates for human viral and bacterial pathogens. Testing showed that after\n30 s of contact with some of the test alloys, Phi6, an enveloped,\nsingle-stranded RNA bacteriophage that serves as a SARS-CoV 2 surrogate, was\nreduced up to 6.9 orders of magnitude (>99.9999%). Additionally, the\nnon-enveloped, double-stranded DNA bacteriophage MS2, and the Gram-negative E.\ncoli and Gram-positive B. subtilis bacterial strains showed a 5.0, 6.4, and 5.7\nlog reduction in activity after 30, 20 and 10 minutes, respectively.\nBioactivity in the alloy samples showed a strong dependence on the composition,\nwith the log reduction scaling directly with the Cu content. Concentration of\nCu by phase separation after annealing improved activity in some of the\nsamples. The results motivate a variety of themes which can be leveraged to\ndesign ideal bioactive surfaces.\n",

        "original_csv_abstract": "  Recently, open-vocabulary image classification by vision language\npre-training has demonstrated incredible achievements, that the model can\nclassify arbitrary categories without seeing additional annotated images of\nthat category. However, it is still unclear how to make the open-vocabulary\nrecognition work well on broader vision problems. This paper targets\nopen-vocabulary semantic segmentation by building it on an off-the-shelf\npre-trained vision-language model, i.e., CLIP. However, semantic segmentation\nand the CLIP model perform on different visual granularity, that semantic\nsegmentation processes on pixels while CLIP performs on images. To remedy the\ndiscrepancy in processing granularity, we refuse the use of the prevalent\none-stage FCN based framework, and advocate a two-stage semantic segmentation\nframework, with the first stage extracting generalizable mask proposals and the\nsecond stage leveraging an image based CLIP model to perform open-vocabulary\nclassification on the masked image crops which are generated in the first\nstage. Our experimental results show that this two-stage framework can achieve\nsuperior performance than FCN when trained only on COCO Stuff dataset and\nevaluated on other datasets without fine-tuning. Moreover, this simple\nframework also surpasses previous state-of-the-arts of zero-shot semantic\nsegmentation by a large margin: +29.5 hIoU on the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset, and\n+8.9 hIoU on the COCO Stuff dataset. With its simplicity and strong\nperformance, we hope this framework to serve as a baseline to facilitate future\nresearch.

The most popular approaches to\nestimate predictive uncertainty in deep learning are methods that combine\npredictions from multiple neural networks, such as Bayesian neural networks\n(BNNs) and deep ensembles. However their practicality in real-time,\nindustrial-scale applications are limited due to the high memory and\ncomputational cost. Furthermore, ensembles and BNNs do not necessarily fix all\nthe issues with the underlying member networks. In this work, we study\nprincipled approaches to improve uncertainty property of a single network,\nbased on a single, deterministic representation. By formalizing the uncertainty\nquantification as a minimax learning problem, we first identify distance\nawareness, i.e., the model's ability to quantify the distance of a testing\nexample from the training data, as a necessary condition for a DNN to achieve\nhigh-quality (i.e., minimax optimal) uncertainty estimation. We then propose\nSpectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Process (SNGP), a simple method that\nimproves the distance-awareness ability of modern DNNs with two simple changes:\n(1) applying spectral normalization to hidden weights to enforce bi-Lipschitz\nsmoothness in representations and (2) replacing the last output layer with a\nGaussian process layer. On a suite of vision and language understanding\nbenchmarks, SNGP outperforms other single-model approaches in prediction,\ncalibration and out-of-domain detection. Furthermore, SNGP provides\ncomplementary benefits to popular techniques such as deep ensembles and data\naugmentation, making it a simple and scalable building block for probabilistic\ndeep learning.

Assuming\nthat perfect security is unrealistic, Moving Target Defense (MTD) is a\npromising approach to mitigate attacks by dynamically altering target attack\nsurfaces. Still, selecting suitable MTD techniques for zero-day attacks is an\nopen challenge.

To improve these limitations, the work at hand proposes an online RL-based\nframework to learn the correct MTD mechanisms mitigating heterogeneous zero-day\nattacks in SBC. The framework considers behavioral fingerprinting to represent\nSBCs' states and RL to learn MTD techniques that mitigate each malicious state.\nIt has been deployed on a real IoT crowdsensing scenario with a Raspberry Pi\nacting as a spectrum sensor. More in detail, the Raspberry Pi has been infected\nwith different samples of command and control malware, rootkits, and ransomware\nto later select between four existing MTD techniques.

Most learned video codecs operate internally in the RGB domain\nfor P-frame coding. B-frame coding for YUV 4:2:0 content is largely\nunder-explored. In addition, while there have been prior works on variable-rate\ncoding with conditional convolution, most of them fail to consider the content\ninformation. We build our scheme on conditional augmented normalized flows\n(CANF). It features conditional motion and inter-frame codecs for efficient\nB-frame coding. To cope with YUV 4:2:0 content, two conditional inter-frame\ncodecs are used to process the Y and UV components separately, with the coding\nof the UV components conditioned additionally on the Y component. Moreover, we\nintroduce adaptive feature modulation in every convolutional layer, taking into\naccount both the content information and the coding levels of B-frames to\nachieve content-adaptive variable-rate coding.

To alleviate this limitation, we purposefully designed WL-Align\nwhich adopts a regularized representation learning framework to learn\ndistinctive node representations.

The representation learning module preserves the second-order\nproximity within individual networks and is regularized by the across-network\nWeisfeiler-Lehman hash labels.

Therefore, it is a\nchallenge to make the model lightweight while reducing the impact of\nintermediate feature loss on the reconstruction quality. In this paper, we\npropose a Feature Interaction Weighted Hybrid Network (FIWHN) to alleviate the\nabove problem. Specifically, FIWHN consists of a series of novel Wide-residual\nDistillation Interaction Blocks (WDIB) as the backbone, where every third WDIBs\nform a Feature shuffle Weighted Group (FSWG) by mutual information mixing and\nfusion. In addition, to mitigate the adverse effects of intermediate feature\nloss on the reconstruction results, we introduced a well-designed Wide\nConvolutional Residual Weighting (WCRW) and Wide Identical Residual Weighting\n(WIRW) units in WDIB, and effectively cross-fused features of different\nfinenesses through a Wide-residual Distillation Connection (WRDC) framework and\na Self-Calibrating Fusion (SCF) unit. Finally, to complement the global\nfeatures lacking in the CNN model, we introduced the Transformer into our model\nand explored a new way of combining the CNN and Transformer. Extensive\nquantitative and qualitative experiments on low-level and high-level tasks show\nthat our proposed FIWHN can achieve a good balance between performance and\nefficiency, and is more conducive to downstream tasks to solve problems in\nlow-pixel scenarios.\n",

A new total energy\nexpression is then proposed, in which a counter term corresponding to the\nenergy of the polarized vacuum is subtracted from the total energy. This\nexpression prevents the possibility of total energy divergence due to electron\ncorrelations, stemming from the fact that the QED Hamiltonian does not conserve\nthe number of particles. Finally, based on the Hamiltonian and energy\nexpression, the Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) and electron correlation methods are\nreintroduced. The resulting QED-based DHF equation has the same form as the\nconventional DHF equation, but also formally describes systems specific to QED,\nsuch as the virtual positrons in the hydride ion and the positron in\npositronium. Three electron correlation methods are derived: the QED-based\nconfiguration interactions and single- and multireference perturbation methods.\nNumerical calculations show that the total energy of the QED Hamiltonian indeed\ndiverges and that the counter term is effective in avoiding the divergence. The\ntheoretical examinations in the present article suggest that the molecular\norbital (MO) methods based on the QED Hamiltonian not only solve the problem of\nthe negative-energy solutions of the relativistic MO method, but also provide a\nrelativistic formalism to treat systems containing positrons.\n",

Despite the elegant\nproof, it was shown by the authors and other researchers that the main result\nin the earlier version of Hansen's paper does not extend the classic\nGauss-Markov theorem because no nonlinear unbiased estimator exists under his\nconditions. To address the issue, Hansen [2022] added statements in the latest\nversion with new conditions under which nonlinear unbiased estimators exist.\n  Motivated by the lively discussion, we study a fundamental problem: what\nestimators are unbiased for a given class of linear models? We first review a\nline of highly relevant work dating back to the 1960s, which, unfortunately,\nhave not drawn enough attention. Then, we introduce notation that allows us to\nrestate and unify results from earlier work and Hansen [2022]. The new\nframework also allows us to highlight differences among previous conclusions.\nLastly, we establish new representation theorems for unbiased estimators under\ndifferent restrictions on the linear model, allowing the coefficients and\ncovariance matrix to take only a finite number of values, the higher moments of\nthe estimator and the dependent variable to exist, and the error distribution\nto be discrete, absolutely continuous, or dominated by another probability\nmeasure.

We propose a specific\ntwo-party communication game in the prepare-measure scenario that relies on an\nencoding-decoding task of specific information. We first demonstrate that\nquantum theory outperforms the classical preparation non-contextual theory, and\nthe optimal quantum success probability of such a communication game enables\nthe semi-device-independent certification of qubit states and measurements.\nFurther, we consider the sequential sharing of quantum preparation\ncontextuality and show that, at most, two sequential observers can share the\nquantum advantage. The sub-optimal quantum advantages for two sequential\nobservers form an optimal pair that certifies a unique value of the unsharpness\nparameter of the first observer.

        "original_csv_abstract": "  In this paper, we propose TensorFHE, an FHE acceleration solution based on\nGPGPU for real applications on encrypted data. TensorFHE utilizes Tensor Core\nUnits (TCUs) to boost the computation of Number Theoretic Transform (NTT),\nwhich is the part of FHE with highest time-cost. Moreover, TensorFHE focuses on\nperforming as many FHE operations as possible in a certain time period rather\nthan reducing the latency of one operation. Based on such an idea, TensorFHE\nintroduces operation-level batching to fully utilize the data parallelism in\nGPGPU. We experimentally prove that it is possible to achieve comparable\nperformance with GPGPU as with state-of-the-art ASIC accelerators. TensorFHE\nperforms 913 KOPS and 88 KOPS for NTT and HMULT (key FHE kernels) within NVIDIA\nA100 GPGPU, which is 2.61x faster than state-of-the-art FHE implementation on\nGPGPU; Moreover, TensorFHE provides comparable performance to the ASIC FHE\naccelerators, which makes it even 2.9x faster than the F1+ with a specific\nworkload. Such a pure software acceleration based on commercial hardware with\nhigh performance can open up usage of state-of-the-art FHE algorithms for a\nbroad set of applications in real systems.\n",

In this\npaper, based on Chebyshev-Davidson algorithm, a new subspace iteration\nalgorithm is constructed.

In this work, we revisit the appropriateness of the Shapley value for\nGNN explanation, where the task is to identify the most important subgraph and\nconstituent nodes for GNN predictions.

Therefore, we extend this\nmethod to arbitrary dendrograms. We develop a generalized framework wherein\ndifferent distance measures and representations can be inferred from different\ntypes of dendrograms, level functions and distance functions. Via an\nappropriate embedding, we compute a vector-based representation of the inferred\ndistances, in order to enable many numerical machine learning algorithms to\nemploy such distances. Then, to address the model selection problem, we study\nthe aggregation of different dendrogram-based distances respectively in\nsolution space and in representation space in the spirit of deep\nrepresentations. In the first approach, for example for the clustering problem,\nwe build a graph with positive and negative edge weights according to the\nconsistency of the clustering labels of different objects among different\nsolutions, in the context of ensemble methods. Then, we use an efficient\nvariant of correlation clustering to produce the final clusters. In the second\napproach, we investigate the combination of different distances and features\nsequentially in the spirit of multi-layered architectures to obtain the final\nfeatures.

The crux of any planning method for\nnon-holonomic robots is the generation of motion primitives that generates\nsolutions to local planning sub-problems. In this work we introduce a novel\nlearnable steering function (policy), which takes into account kinodynamic\nconstraints of the robot and both static and dynamic obstacles.

However, such\npanoptic architectures do not truly unify image segmentation because they need\nto be trained individually on the semantic, instance, or panoptic segmentation\nto achieve the best performance. Ideally, a truly universal framework should be\ntrained only once and achieve SOTA performance across all three image\nsegmentation tasks. To that end, we propose OneFormer, a universal image\nsegmentation framework that unifies segmentation with a multi-task train-once\ndesign. We first propose a task-conditioned joint training strategy that\nenables training on ground truths of each domain (semantic, instance, and\npanoptic segmentation) within a single multi-task training process. Secondly,\nwe introduce a task token to condition our model on the task at hand, making\nour model task-dynamic to support multi-task training and inference. Thirdly,\nwe propose using a query-text contrastive loss during training to establish\nbetter inter-task and inter-class distinctions. Notably, our single OneFormer\nmodel outperforms specialized Mask2Former models across all three segmentation\ntasks on ADE20k, CityScapes, and COCO, despite the latter being trained on each\nof the three tasks individually with three times the resources.

We show numerically in one\ndimension that such a domain wall is more prominent for repulsive contact\ninteractions, and becomes metastable at strong electric fields through a\nfirst-order phase transition that ends at a critical point as the field is\nreduced. Our findings build on recent experimental developments and may be\nrealized with cold atoms in a shaken optical lattice, providing insights into\ncollective phenomena arising from dynamical gauge fields.\n",

Their incidence reaches 30% when\nsubclinical or non-convulsive seizures are diagnosed by continuous\nelectroencephalogram. Several risk factors for seizures have been described\nincluding cortical location of intracerebral hemorrhage, presence of\nintraventricular hemorrhage, total hemorrhage volume, and history of alcohol\nabuse. Seizures after intracerebral hemorrhage may theoretically be harmful as\nthey can lead to sudden blood pressure fluctuations, increase intracranial\npressure and neuronal injury due to increased metabolic demand. Some recent\nstudies suggest that acute symptomatic seizures (occurring within seven days of\nstroke) are associated with worse functional outcome and increased risk of\ndeath despite accounting for other known prognostic factors such as age and\nbaseline hemorrhage volume. However, the impact of seizures on prognosis is\nstill debated and it remains unclear if treating or preventing seizures might\nlead to improved clinical outcome. Thus, the currently available scientific\nevidence does not support the routine use of antiseizure medication as primary\nprevention among patients with intracerebral hemorrhage.

Key parameters such\nas switching field and speed depend on the static and dynamic properties of\ndomain walls (DWs). Here we theoretically explore the properties of textures in\nstacking-engineered ferroelectrics from first principles. Employing a\nmachine-learning potential model, we present results of large-scale atomistic\nsimulations of stacking DWs and Moir\\'e structure of boron nitride bilayers. We\npredict that the competition between the switching barrier of stable\nferroelectric states and the in-plane lattice distortion leads to a DW width of\nthe order of ten nanometers. DWs motion reduces the critical ferroelectric\nswitching field of a monodomain by two orders of magnitude, while high\ndomain-wall velocities allow domain switching on a picosecond-timescale. The\nsuperior performance compared to conventional ferroelectrics (or ferromagnets)\nmay enable ultrafast and power-saving non-volatile memories. By twisting the\nbilayer into a stacking Moir\\'e structure, the ferroelectric transforms into a\nsuper-paraelectric since DWs move under ultralow electric fields.\n",

On the one\nhand, some methods alleviate the predicted inconsistent problem between\ncontinuous frames. On the other hand, other methods employ the previous frame\nas the prior information to assist in segmenting the current frame. Although\nthe previous methods achieve superior performances on the independent and\nidentically distributed (i.i.d) data, they can not generalize well on other\nunseen domains. Thus, we explore a new task, the video generalizable semantic\nsegmentation (VGSS) task that considers both continuous frames and domain\ngeneralization. In this paper, we propose a class-wise non-salient region\ngeneralized (CNSG) framework for the VGSS task. Concretely, we first define the\nclass-wise non-salient feature, which describes features of the class-wise\nnon-salient region that carry more generalizable information. Then, we propose\na class-wise non-salient feature reasoning strategy to select and enhance the\nmost generalized channels adaptively. Finally, we propose an inter-frame\nnon-salient centroid alignment loss to alleviate the predicted inconsistent\nproblem in the VGSS task. We also extend our video-based framework to the\nimage-based generalizable semantic segmentation (IGSS) task. Experiments\ndemonstrate that our CNSG framework yields significant improvement in the VGSS\nand IGSS tasks.\n",

The agent\nonly knows where the goal state is when it reaches it. How do we reach this\ngoal while moving only a small distance? This problem seems hopeless, even on\ntrees of bounded degree, unless we give the agent some help. This setting with\n''help'' often arises in exploring large search spaces (e.g., huge game trees)\nwhere we assume access to some score/quality function for each node, which we\nuse to guide us towards the goal. In our case, we assume the help comes in the\nform of distance predictions: each node $v$ provides a prediction $f(v)$ of its\ndistance to the goal vertex. Naturally if these predictions are correct, we can\nreach the goal along a shortest path. What if the predictions are unreliable\nand some of them are erroneous? Can we get an algorithm whose performance\nrelates to the error of the predictions?\n  In this work, we consider the problem on trees and give deterministic\nalgorithms whose total movement cost is only $O(OPT + \\Delta \\cdot ERR)$, where\n$OPT$ is the distance from the start to the goal vertex, $\\Delta$ the maximum\ndegree, and the $ERR$ is the total number of vertices whose predictions are\nerroneous. We show this guarantee is optimal. We then consider a ''planning''\nversion of the problem where the graph and predictions are known at the\nbeginning, so the agent can use this global information to devise a search\nstrategy of low cost. For this planning version, we go beyond trees and give an\nalgorithms which gets good performance on (weighted) graphs with bounded\ndoubling dimension.\n",

In two party-two measurement per\nparty-two outcomes per measurement $(2-2-2)$ Bell scenario, any argument of\nBell nonlocality is a proof of trivial preparation contextuality; however, the\nconverse may not hold. If one of the parties (say, Alice) performs the\nmeasurements of more than two dichotomic observables, then it is possible to\nfind a set of non-trivial functional relations between Alice's observables. We\nargue that the existence of a suitable set of such non-trivial relations\nbetween Alice's observables may warrant the unsteerability of quantum states at\nthe end of another spatially separated party (say, Bob). Interestingly, such\nconstraints can be read as non-trivial preparation non-contextuality\nassumptions in an ontological model. We further demonstrate two types of Bell\ninequalities that can be converted into linear steering inequalities using the\naforementioned non-trivial conditions on Alice's observables. Such steering\ninequalities can also be considered as non-trivial preparation noncontextual\ninequalities. Since the local bound of the family of Bell expression gets\nreduced under the additional non-trivial conditions, it provides a test of\nquantum steering and nonlocality from the same family of Bell expressions\ndepending upon its violation of the non-trivial preparation non-contextual or\nthe local bound, thereby establishing a direct connection between quantum\nsteering and non-trivial preparation contextuality.\n",

Our results have several further implications. First, our approach\nworks for both even and odd pure $p$-spin models. The leading cluster\nstructures in the odd $p$ case are different and more involved than in the even\n$p$ case. This combinatorially explains the folklore that odd $p$-spin is more\ncomplicated than even $p$. Second, in the mixed $p$-spin setting, the cluster\nstructures differ depending on the relation between the minimum effective even\nand odd $p$-spins: $p_e$ and $p_o$. As an example, at $h=0$, there are three\nsub-regimes: $p_e<p_o, p_o<p_e<2p_o, p_e\\ge 2p_o$, wherein the first and third\nones, the mixed model behaves essentially like a pure $p$-spin model, and only\nin the second regime, it is more like a mixture. This gives another criterion\nfor classifying mean-field spin glass models compared to the work of Auffinger\nand Ben Arous (Ann.~Probab.~41 (2013), no.~6, 4214--4247), where the idea is\nbased on complexity computations for spherical models.

The laboratory spectra of the Murchison samples exhibit characteristic\nchanges in the infrared features. A weakly shocked sample (shocked at 10 GPa)\nshows almost no changes from the unshocked sample dominated by hydrous silicate\n(serpentine). Moderately shocked samples (21 to 34 GPa) have typical serpentine\nfeatures gradually replaced by bands of amorphous material and olivine with\nincreasing shock pressure. A strongly shocked sample (36 GPa) shows major\nchanges due to decomposition of the serpentine and due to devolatilization. A\nshock melted sample (49 GPa) shows features of olivine recrystallized from\nmelted material. The spectra of highly shocked Murchison samples (36 and 49\nGPa) are similar to those of dust in the debris disks of HD113766 and HD69830,\nand the transitional disk of HD100546. The moderately shocked samples (21 to 34\nGPa) exhibit spectra similar to those of dust in the debris disks of Beta\nPictoris and BD+20307, and the transitional disk of GM Aur. An average of the\nspectra of all Murchison samples (0 to 49 GPa) has a similarity to the spectrum\nof the older protoplanetary disk of SU Auriga. In the gas-rich transitional and\nprotoplanetary disks, the abundances of amorphous silicates and gases have\nwidely been considered to be a primary property. However, our study suggests\nthat impact processing may play a significant role in generating secondary\namorphous silicates and gases in those disks.

Since current\nblockchain systems lack the support for querying data with embedded security\nand privacy guarantees, there exists inherent security and privacy concerns on\nthose systems. In particular, existing systems require users to submit queries\nto blockchain operators (e.g., a node validator) in plaintext.

Here we present a novel hybrid framework for identifying a parent-child\ndyad's joint engagement by combining a deep learning framework with various\nvideo augmentation techniques.

In our work, we define a macro-block that contains a large number of\nunits from the input to a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Rather than applying\ndropout to each unit, we apply random dropout to each macro-block. This\nalgorithm has the effect of applying different drop out rates for each layer\neven if we keep a constant average dropout rate, which has better\nregularization effects. In our experiments using Recurrent Neural\nNetwork-Transducer (RNN-T), this algorithm shows relatively 4.30 % and 6.13 %\nWord Error Rates (WERs) improvement over the conventional dropout on\nLibriSpeech test-clean and test-other. With an Attention-based Encoder-Decoder\n(AED) model, this algorithm shows relatively 4.36 % and 5.85 % WERs improvement\nover the conventional dropout on the same test sets.\n",

As such, we apply the same method that we\ndevelopped for the unramified case in two previous papers. More precisely, we\nfirst investigate the cohomology of a given closed Bruhat-Tits stratum. It is\nisomorphic to a generalized Deligne-Lusztig variety which is in general not\nsmooth, and is associated to a finite group of symplectic similitudes. We\ndetermine the weights of the Frobenius and most of the unipotent\nrepresentations occuring in its cohomology. This computation involves the\nspectral sequence associated to a stratification by classical Deligne-Lusztig\nvarieties, which are parabolically induced from Coxeter varieties of smaller\nsymplectic groups. In particular, all the unipotent representations contribute\nto only two cuspidal series. Then, we introduce the analytical tubes of the\nclosed Bruhat-Tits strata, which give an open cover of the generic fiber of the\nRapoport-Zink space. Using the associated \\v{C}ech spectral sequence, we prove\nthat certain cohomology groups of the Rapoport-Zink space at hyperspecial level\nfail to be admissible if $n$ is large enough. Eventually, when $n=2$ in the\nsplit case, when $n=3$ and when $n=4$ in the non-split case, we give a complete\ndescription of the cohomology of the supersingular locus of the associated\nShimura variety at hyperspecial level, in terms of automorphic representations.\nIn particular, certain automorphic representations occur with a multiplicity\ndepending on $p$. Thus, our computations in the ramified case recover all the\nmain features of the unramified case, despite new technical difficulties due to\nthe closed Bruhat-Tits strata not being smooth.\n",

The ubiquitous system logs contain plentiful information\nand are thus widely exploited as an alternative source for system management.\nAs log files usually encompass large amounts of raw data, manually analyzing\nthem is laborious and error-prone. Consequently, many research endeavors have\nbeen devoted to automatic log analysis. However, these works typically expect\nstructured input and struggle with the heterogeneous nature of raw system logs.\nLog parsing closes this gap by converting the unstructured system logs to\nstructured records. Many parsers were proposed during the last decades to\naccommodate various log analysis applications. However, due to the ample\nsolution space and lack of systematic evaluation, it is not easy for\npractitioners to find ready-made solutions that fit their needs.\n  This paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey on log parsing. We begin\nwith an exhaustive taxonomy of existing log parsers. Then we empirically\nanalyze the critical performance and operational features for 17 open-source\nsolutions both quantitatively and qualitatively, and whenever applicable\ndiscuss the merits of alternative approaches. We also elaborate on future\nchallenges and discuss the relevant research directions. We envision this\nsurvey as a helpful resource for system administrators and domain experts to\nchoose the most desirable open-source solution or implement new ones based on\napplication-specific requirements.\n",

In\nrecent years, numerous machine learning algorithms have been proposed for RUL\nestimation, mainly focusing on providing more accurate RUL predictions.\nHowever, there are many sources of uncertainty in the problem, such as inherent\nrandomness of systems failure, lack of knowledge regarding their future states,\nand inaccuracy of the underlying predictive models, making it infeasible to\npredict the RULs precisely. Hence, it is of utmost importance to quantify the\nuncertainty alongside the RUL predictions. In this work, we investigate the\nconformal prediction (CP) framework that represents uncertainty by predicting\nsets of possible values for the target variable (intervals in the case of RUL)\ninstead of making point predictions. Under very mild technical assumptions, CP\nformally guarantees that the actual value (true RUL) is covered by the\npredicted set with a degree of certainty that can be prespecified. We study\nthree CP algorithms to conformalize any single-point RUL predictor and turn it\ninto a valid interval predictor. Finally, we conformalize two single-point RUL\npredictors, deep convolutional neural networks and gradient boosting, and\nillustrate their performance on the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System\nSimulation (C-MAPSS) data sets.\n",

The potential energy\nsurface of a multi-element system is represented as a many-body expansion of\nparametrized potentials which are functions of atom positions, atom types, and\nparameters. The Karhunen-Lo\\`eve expansion is employed to decompose the\nparametrized potentials into a set of orthogonal basis functions. The\northogonal basis functions are used to construct proper orthogonal descriptors\nbased on the elements of atoms, thus leading to multi-element descriptors. For\na system of $N_{\\rm e}$ elements, the number of multi-element proper orthogonal\ndescriptors increases as $O(N_{\\rm e}^3)$, while the computational cost is\nindependent of $N_{\\rm e}$. We compose the multi-element proper orthogonal\ndescriptors to develop two different interatomic potentials. The first\npotential expresses the energy of each atom as a linear combination of proper\northogonal descriptors, while the second potential expresses the energy as a\nlinear and quadratic combination of the descriptors. The second potential is\nshown to provide a significant increase in accuracy relative to the first\npotential, while having the same computational complexity as the first\npotential.

In this paper, we propose a\nHierarchical Temporal-Aware video-language pre-training framework, HiTeA, with\ntwo novel pre-training tasks for modeling cross-modal alignment between moments\nand texts as well as the temporal relations of video-text pairs. Specifically,\nwe propose a cross-modal moment exploration task to explore moments in videos,\nwhich results in detailed video moment representation. Besides, the inherent\ntemporal relations are captured by aligning video-text pairs as a whole in\ndifferent time resolutions with multi-modal temporal relation exploration task.\nFurthermore, we introduce the shuffling test to evaluate the temporal reliance\nof datasets and video-language pre-training models. We achieve state-of-the-art\nresults on 15 well-established video-language understanding and generation\ntasks, especially on temporal-oriented datasets (e.g., SSv2-Template and\nSSv2-Label) with 8.6% and 11.1% improvement respectively. HiTeA also\ndemonstrates strong generalization ability when directly transferred to\ndownstream tasks in a zero-shot manner. Models and demo will be available on\nModelScope.\n",

Most research on\nholographic MIMO is based on isotropic scattering environments, and the antenna\ngain is assumed to be unlimited by deployment space. However, the channel might\nnot satisfy isotropic scattering because of generalized angle distributions,\nand the antenna gain is limited by the array aperture in reality. In this\nletter, we aim to analyze the holographic MIMO channel capacity under practical\nangle distribution and array aperture constraints. First, we calculate the\nspectral density for generalized angle distributions by introducing a\nwavenumber domain-based method. And then, the capacity under generalized angle\ndistributions is analyzed and two different aperture schemes are considered.\nFinally, numerical results show that the capacity is obviously affected by\nangle distribution at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) but hardly affected at\nlow SNR, and the capacity will not increase infinitely with antenna density due\nto the array aperture constraint.\n",

        "original_csv_abstract": "  This paper presents a dual-aptamer scheme to cancel the signal drifts from\nstructure-switching aptamers during long-term monitoring. Electrochemical\naptamer-based (E-AB) biosensors recently demonstrated their great potential for\nin vivo continuous monitoring. Nevertheless, the detection accuracy is often\nlimited by the signaling drifts. Conventionally, these drifts are removed by\nthe kinetic differential measurements (KDM) when coupled with square-wave\nvoltammetry. Yet we discover that KDM does not apply to every aptamer as the\nresponses at different SWV frequencies heavily depend on its\nstructure-switching characteristics and the redox reporters' electron transfer\n(ET) kinetics. To this end, we present a \"dual-aptamer\" scheme that uses two\naptamers responding differentially to the same molecular target for drift\ncancellation. We identify these paired aptamers through (1) screening from the\nexisting aptamers pool and (2) engineering the signaling behavior of the redox\nreporters. We demonstrate their differential signaling to ampicillin and ATP\nmolecules and show that the aptamer pair bears common drifts in undilute goat\nserum. Through cancellation, sensor drift is reduced by 370-fold. Benefiting\nfrom the \"differential\" signaling, the recording throughput is also doubled\nusing differential readout electronics. The authors believe the proposed\ntechnique is beneficial for long-term in vivo monitoring.\n",

We construct an age-metallicity relation (AMR) for\nthe clusters in the LMC. For this purpose, we used Str\\\"omgren photometry\nobtained with the SOI camera on the 4.1 m SOAR telescope. We found the mean\nmetallicity and age for 110 star clusters. For the remaining 37, we provide an\nage estimation only. To the best of our knowledge, for 29 clusters from our\nsample, we provide both the metallicity and age for the first time, whereas for\n66 clusters, we provide a first determination of the metallicity, and for 43\nclusters, the first estimation of the age. We also calculated the mean\nmetallicities for stars from 80 fields around the clusters. The old, metal-poor\nstar clusters occur both in and out of the LMC bar region, while\nintermediate-age clusters are located mostly outside of the bar. The majority\nof star clusters younger than 1 Gyr are located in the bar region. We find a\ngood agreement between our AMR and theoretical models of the LMC chemical\nenrichment, as well as with AMRs for clusters from the literature. Next, we\ntook advantage of 26 stellar clusters from our sample which host Cepheid\nvariables and used them as an independent check of the correctness of our age\ndetermination procedure. We used period-age relations for Cepheids to calculate\nthe mean age of a given cluster and compared it with the age obtained from\nisochrone fitting. We find good agreement between these ages, especially for\nmodels taking into account additional physical processes (e.g., rotation). We\nalso compared the AMR of the LMC and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) derived in a\nuniform way and we note that they indicate possible former interaction between\nthese two galaxies.\n",

Our method is motivated by the observation that the distance between the state of interest and its diagonal parts in the …",

A\npromising way to bridge these widely different frequencies is using\nhigh-frequency nanomechanical resonators interacting with low-loss optical\nmodes. State-of-the-art optomechanical devices require a relatively large\nphoton population in the cavity to enhance the acousto-optic coupling, the heat\narising from undesirable optical absorption, however, generates thermal phonons\nthat ultimately hinder their operation in the quantum regime. One way to\novercome this problem is by using dissipative optomechanics. In this framework,\nphotons can be scattered directly from a waveguide into a resonator, reducing\nthe need for a large intra-cavity photon population. Hitherto, such dissipative\noptomechanical interaction was only demonstrated at low mechanical frequencies,\nprecluding the quantum state transfer between photonic and phononic domains.\nHere, we show the first dissipative optomechanical system operating in the\nsideband-resolved regime, where the mechanical frequency is larger than the\noptical linewidth. Exploring this unprecedented regime, we demonstrate the\nimpact of dissipative optomechanical coupling in reshaping both mechanical and\noptical spectra. Our figures represent a two-order-of-magnitude leap in the\nmechanical frequency and a tenfold increase in the dissipative optomechanical\ncoupling rate compared to previous works.

The agent can use\nits experience in each task and across tasks to estimate both the transition\nmodel and the distribution over tasks. We propose an algorithm to meta-learn\nthe underlying structure across tasks, utilize it to plan in each task, and\nupper-bound the regret of the planning loss. Our bound suggests that the\naverage regret over tasks decreases as the number of tasks increases and as the\ntasks are more similar. In the classical single-task setting, it is known that\nthe planning horizon should depend on the estimated model's accuracy, that is,\non the number of samples within task. We generalize this finding to meta-RL and\nstudy this dependence of planning horizons on the number of tasks. Based on our\ntheoretical findings, we derive heuristics for selecting slowly increasing\ndiscount factors, and we validate its significance empirically.\n",

However, these methods do not consider the heterogeneous\nrelations in the code structure graph, i.e., different types of nodes and\nedges, which may obstruct the graph representation learning.

We demonstrate that in the symmetric case when the sharing is\nconsidered for both the edge parties, the nonlocality can be shared by at most\ntwo sequential observers per edge party. However, in the asymmetric case, when\nthe sharing across one edge party is considered, we show that at most, six\nsequential observers can share the nonlocality in the network. We extend our\ninvestigation to the two-input $n$-local scenario in the star-network\nconfiguration that features an arbitrary $n$ number of edge parties and one\ncentral party. In the asymmetric case, we demonstrate that the network\nnonlocality can be shared by an unbounded number of sequential observers across\none edge party for a suitably large value of $n$. Further, we generalize our\nstudy for an arbitrary $m$ input $n$-local scenario in the star-network\nconfiguration. We show that even for an arbitrary $m$ input scenario, the\nnonlocality can be shared by an unbounded number of sequential observers.\nHowever, increasing the input $m$, one has to employ more number of edge\nparties $n$ than that of the two-input case to demonstrate the sharing of an\nunbounded number of sequential observers.\n",

Our contributions in this paper span\nboth the conceptual and theoretical frontiers: we discuss some of the unique\nproperties of the Voronoigram in comparison to TV-regularized estimators that\nuse other graph-based discretizations; we derive the asymptotic limit of the\nVoronoi TV functional; and we prove that the Voronoigram is minimax rate\noptimal (up to log factors) for estimating BV functions that are essentially\nbounded.\n",

Although there are some open-source, labeled datasets of CFPs in the\nophthalmology community, large-scale datasets for screening only have labels of\ndisease categories, and datasets with annotations of fundus structures are\nusually small in size. In addition, labeling standards are not uniform across\ndatasets, and there is no clear information on the acquisition device. Here we\nrelease a multi-annotation, multi-quality, and multi-device color fundus image\ndataset for glaucoma analysis on an original challenge -- Retinal Fundus\nGlaucoma Challenge 2nd Edition (REFUGE2). The REFUGE2 dataset contains 2000\ncolor fundus images with annotations of glaucoma classification, optic disc/cup\nsegmentation, as well as fovea localization. Meanwhile, the REFUGE2 challenge\nsets three sub-tasks of automatic glaucoma diagnosis and fundus structure\nanalysis and provides an online evaluation framework. Based on the\ncharacteristics of multi-device and multi-quality data, some methods with\nstrong generalizations are provided in the challenge to make the predictions\nmore robust. This shows that REFUGE2 brings attention to the characteristics of\nreal-world multi-domain data, bridging the gap between scientific research and\nclinical application.\n",

Knowing the changing physical constraints on human\nmotion can improve inspection of safe human motions and bring essential\ninformation about stability and normality of human body orientations with\nreal-time risk assessment. Also, this information can be used in cooperative\nrobots and monitoring systems to evaluate and interact in the environment more\nfreely.

The PSM encompasses a 3-Dofs\nspring-damper pendulum model that predicts human motion based on a safe motion\ndataset.

One of the key points is to quantitatively\ndetermine the position of the shock front in the nozzle. We focus on the\ncontributions of the perturbation of the flat nozzle and the exothermic\nreaction in determining the position of the shock front by comparing the orders\nof $\\sigma$ and $\\kappa$, where $\\sigma$ represents the scale of the\nperturbation of the flat nozzle and $\\kappa$ the rate of the exothermic\nreaction. To this end, a free boundary problem for the linearized reacting\nEuler system is proposed to catch an approximating position of the shock front\nas well as the associated approximating shock solution, with which the\nexistence of a shock solution close to it can be established via a nonlinear\niteration scheme. One of the key steps is solving the nonlinear equation\nderived from the solvability condition for the elliptic sub-problem in the\ndomain of the subsonic flow behind the shock front, which determines the free\nboundary of the proposed problem. Four typical cases are analyzed which\ndescribe possible interactions between the geometry of the nozzle boundary and\nthe exothermic reaction. The results also manifest that exothermic reaction has\na stabilization effect on transonic shocks in the nozzles.\n",

In recent times, network nonlocality has been\nstudied for various topologies. We consider a linear-chain topology of the\nnetwork and demonstrate the quantum nonlocality (the non-$n$-locality). Such a\nnetwork scenario involves $n$ number of independent sources and $n+1$ parties,\ntwo edge parties (Alice and Charlie), and $n-1$ central parties (Bobs). It is\ncommonly assumed that each party receives only two inputs. In this work, we\nconsider a generalized scenario where the edge parties receive an arbitrary $n$\nnumber of inputs (equals to a number of independent sources), and each of the\ncentral parties receives two inputs. We derive a family of generalized\n$n$-locality inequalities for a linear-chain network for arbitrary $n$ and\ndemonstrate the optimal quantum violation of the inequalities. We introduce an\nelegant sum-of-squares approach enabling the derivation of the optimal quantum\nviolation of aforesaid inequalities \\emph{without} assuming the dimension of\nthe system. We show that the optimal quantum violation requires the observables\nof edge parties to mutually anticommuting. For $n=2$ and $3$, the optimal\nquantum violation can be obtained when each edge party shares a two-qubit\nentangled state with central parties. We further argue that for $n\\geq 2$, a\nsingle copy of a two-qubit-entangled state may not be enough to exhibit the\nviolation of $n$-locality inequality, but multiple copies of it can activate\nthe quantum violation.\n",

The insurer can purchase\nper-loss reinsurance from the reinsurer. With the insurer's feedback\nreinsurance strategy, the reinsurer optimizes the reinsurance premium in the\nStackelberg game. The financial market consists of cash and stock with Heston's\nstochastic volatility. Both the insurer and reinsurer maximize their respective\n$\\alpha$-maxmin mean-variance preferences in the market. The criterion is\ntime-inconsistent and we derive the equilibrium strategies by the extended\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. Similar to the non-robust case in Li and\nYoung (2022), excess-of-loss reinsurance is the optimal form of reinsurance\nstrategy for the insurer. The equilibrium investment strategy is determined by\na system of Riccati differential equations. Besides, the equations determining\nthe equilibrium reinsurance strategy and reinsurance premium rate are given\nsemi-explicitly, which is simplified to an algebraic equation in a specific\nexample. Numerical examples illustrate that the game between the insurer and\nreinsurer makes the insurance more radical when the agents become more\nambiguity aversion or risk aversion. Furthermore, the level of ambiguity,\nambiguity attitude, and risk attitude of the insurer (reinsurer) have similar\neffects on the equilibrium reinsurance strategy, reinsurance premium, and\ninvestment strategy.\n",

Most related studies tackle the problems by\nlearning the transition parameters of a time-homogeneous Markov process.\nNonetheless, most real-world population flows can be influenced by various\nuncertainties such as traffic jam and weather conditions. Thus, in many cases,\na time-homogeneous Markov model is a poor approximation of the much more\ncomplex population flows. To circumvent this difficulty, we resort to a\nmulti-marginal optimal transport (MOT) formulation that can naturally represent\naggregated observations with constrained marginals, and encode time-dependent\ntransition matrices by the cost functions. In particular, we propose to\nestimate the transition flows from aggregated data by learning the cost\nfunctions of the MOT framework, which enables us to capture time-varying\ndynamic patterns.

        "original_csv_abstract": "  With the great success of the T-product based real tensor methods in the\ncolor image and gray video processing, the establishment of T-product based\nquaternion tensor methods in the color video processing has encountered a\nchallenge, which is the block diagonalization of block circulant quaternion\nmatrices. In this paper, we show that the discrete Fourier matrix\n$\\mathbf{F_p}$ cannot diagonalize $p\\times p$ circulant quaternion matrices,\nnor can the unitary quaternion matrices $\\mathbf{F_p}\\mathbf{j}$ and\n$\\mathbf{F_p}(1+\\mathbf{j})/\\sqrt{2}$ with $\\mathbf{j}$ being an imaginary unit\nof quaternion algebra. Further, we establish sufficient and necessary\nconditions for a unitary quaternion matrix being a diagonalization matrix of\ncirculant quaternion matrices, which shows that achieving the diagonalization\nof circulant quaternion matrices in the quaternion domain is too hard. We turn\nto the octonion domain for achieving the diagonalization of circulant\nquaternion matrices. We prove that the unitary octonion matrix\n$\\mathbf{F_p}\\mathbf{p}$ with $\\mathbf{p}=\\mathbf{l},\\mathbf{il}$ or\n$(\\mathbf{l}+\\mathbf{il})/\\sqrt{2}$ can diagonalize a circulant quaternion\nmatrix of size $p\\times p$, at the cost of $O(p\\log p)$ via the fast Fourier\ntransform (FFT); and unitary matrices $\\mathbf{F_p}\\mathbf{p}\\otimes\n\\mathbf{I_m}$ and $\\mathbf{F_p}\\mathbf{p}\\otimes \\mathbf{I_n}$ can block\ndiagonalize a block circulant quaternion matrix of size $mp\\times np$, at the\ncost of $O(mnp\\log p)$ via the FFT. As a result, we propose a fast algorithm to\ncalculate the T-product between $m\\times n\\times p$ and $n\\times s\\times p$\nthird-order quaternion tensors via FFTs, at the cost of $O(mnsp)$, which is\nalmost $1/p$ of the computational magnitude of computing T-product by its\ndefinition. Numerical calculations verify the correctness of the complexity\nanalysis.\n",

While those techniques have pros and cons that trade-off\ncomputational efficiency and the susceptibility of getting trapped in local\nminima, an alternate approach is needed that allows robust localization\nperformance and holds the potential to make the elusive goal of real-time\nmicroseismic monitoring possible. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have\nappeared on the scene as a flexible and versatile framework for solving partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs) along with the associated initial or boundary\nconditions. We develop HypoPINN -- a PINN-based inversion framework for\nhypocenter localization and introduce an approximate Bayesian framework for\nestimating its predictive uncertainties. This work focuses on predicting the\nhypocenter locations using HypoPINN and investigates the propagation of\nuncertainties from the random realizations of HypoPINN's weights and biases\nusing the Laplace approximation. We train HypoPINN to obtain the optimized\nweights for predicting hypocenter location. Next, we approximate the covariance\nmatrix at the optimized HypoPINN's weights for posterior sampling with the\nLaplace approximation. The posterior samples represent various realizations of\nHypoPINN's weights. Finally, we predict the locations of the hypocenter\nassociated with those weights' realizations to investigate the uncertainty\npropagation that comes from those realisations. We demonstrate the features of\nthis methodology through several numerical examples, including using the Otway\nvelocity model based on the Otway project in Australia.\n",

Examples include long-term health effects of medical\ninterventions, measurements requiring expensive testing or follow-up, and\noutcomes only measurable on small panels as in marketing. This reduces\neffective sample sizes for estimating the average treatment effect (ATE).\nHowever, there is often an abundance of observations on surrogate outcomes not\nof primary interest, such as short-term health effects or online-ad\nclick-through. We study the role of such surrogate observations in the\nefficient estimation of treatment effects. To quantify their value, we derive\nthe semiparametric efficiency bounds on ATE estimation with and without the\npresence of surrogates and several intermediary settings. The difference\nbetween these characterizes the efficiency gains from optimally leveraging\nsurrogates. We study two regimes: when the number of surrogate observations is\ncomparable to primary-outcome observations and when the former dominates the\nlatter. We take an agnostic missing-data approach circumventing strong\nsurrogate conditions previously assumed. To leverage surrogates' efficiency\ngains, we develop efficient ATE estimation and inference based on flexible\nmachine-learning estimates of nuisance functions appearing in the influence\nfunctions we derive.

A quantitative analysis of the charge transfer errors in a few\ntransition states confirms this trend. We do not have the exact functional and\nexact densities that are needed to evaluate the exact density- and\nfunctional-driven errors for the large BH76 database of barrier heights.\nInstead, we have identified and used three non-local proxy functionals (the\nSCAN 50% global hybrid, the range-separated hybrid LC-$\\omega$PBE, and\nSCAN-FLOSIC) and their self-consistent densities. These functionals yield\nreasonably accurate self-consistent barrier heights, and their self-consistent\ntotal energies are nearly piecewise linear in fractional electron number - two\nimportant points of similarity to the exact functional. We argue that\ndensity-driven errors of the energy in a self-consistent density functional\ncalculation are second-order in the density error, and that large\ndensity-driven errors arise primarily from incorrect electron transfers over\nlength scales larger than the diameter of an atom.\n",

However, achieving such\npredictions faces two challenges, mainly due to the diversity of students'\nbackground and the necessity of continuously tracking their evolving progress.\nThe goal of this work is to create a system able to automatically detect\nstudents in difficulty, for instance predicting if they are likely to fail a\ncourse. We compare a naive approach widely used in the literature, which uses\nattributes available in the data set (like the grades), with a personalized\napproach we called Personalized Student Attribute Inference (PSAI). With our\nmodel, we create personalized attributes to capture the specific background of\neach student. Both approaches are compared using machine learning algorithms\nlike decision trees, support vector machine or neural networks.\n",

        "original_csv_abstract": "  Supervised learning methods have been suffering from the fact that a\nlarge-scale labeled dataset is mandatory, which is difficult to obtain. This\nhas been a more significant issue for fashion compatibility prediction because\ncompatibility aims to capture people's perception of aesthetics, which are\nsparse and changing. Thus, the labeled dataset may become outdated quickly due\nto fast fashion. Moreover, labeling the dataset always needs some expert\nknowledge; at least they should have a good sense of aesthetics. However, there\nare limited self/semi-supervised learning techniques in this field. In this\npaper, we propose a general color distortion prediction task forcing the\nbaseline to recognize low-level image information to learn more discriminative\nrepresentation for fashion compatibility prediction. Specifically, we first\npropose to distort the image by adjusting the image color balance, contrast,\nsharpness, and brightness. Then, we propose adding Gaussian noise to the\ndistorted image before passing them to the convolutional neural network (CNN)\nbackbone to learn a probability distribution over all possible distortions. The\nproposed pretext task is adopted in the state-of-the-art methods in fashion\ncompatibility and shows its effectiveness in improving these methods' ability\nin extracting better feature representations. Applying the proposed pretext\ntask to the baseline can consistently outperform the original baseline.\n",

Consequently, ISO/SAE 21434 and UN R155\n(2021) define a standard and regulatory framework for automotive cybersecurity.\nBoth documents follow a risk management-based approach and require a threat\nmodeling methodology for risk analysis and identification. Such a threat\nmodeling methodology must conform to the Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment\n(TARA) framework of ISO/SAE 21434. Conversely, existing threat modeling methods\nenumerate isolated threats disregarding the vehicle's design and connections.\nConsequently, they neglect the role of attack paths from a vehicle's interfaces\nto its assets. In other words, they are missing the TARA work products, e.g.,\nattack paths compromising assets or feasibility and impact ratings. We propose\na threat modeling methodology to construct attack paths by identifying,\nsequencing, and connecting vulnerabilities from a valid attack surface to an\nasset. Initially, we transform cybersecurity guidelines to attack trees, and\nthen we use their formal interpretations to assess the vehicle's design. This\nworkflow yields compositional construction of attack paths along with the\nrequired TARA work products (e.g., attack paths, feasibility, and impact). More\nimportantly, we can apply the workflow iteratively in the context of connected\nvehicles to ensure design conformity, privacy, and cybersecurity.

Among them, decomposition-based methods have achieved promising\nresults. Most decomposition-based methods approximate a single function, which\nis insufficient for obtaining accurate results. Moreover, most existing\nresearches have concentrated on one-step-ahead forecasting that prevents stock\nmarket investors from arriving at the best decisions for the future. This study\nproposes two novel methods for multi-step-ahead stock price prediction based on\nthe issues outlined. DCT-MFRFNN, a method based on discrete cosine transform\n(DCT) and multi-functional recurrent fuzzy neural network (MFRFNN), uses DCT to\nreduce fluctuations in the time series and simplify its structure and MFRFNN to\npredict the stock price. VMD-MFRFNN, an approach based on variational mode\ndecomposition (VMD) and MFRFNN, brings together their advantages. VMD-MFRFNN\nconsists of two phases. The input signal is decomposed to several IMFs using\nVMD in the decomposition phase. In the prediction and reconstruction phase,\neach of the IMFs is given to a separate MFRFNN for prediction, and predicted\nsignals are summed to reconstruct the output. Three financial time series,\nincluding Hang Seng Index (HSI), Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE), and Standard &\nPoor's 500 Index (SPX), are used for the evaluation of the proposed methods.\nExperimental results indicate that VMD-MFRFNN surpasses other state-of-the-art\nmethods. VMD-MFRFNN, on average, shows 35.93%, 24.88%, and 34.59% decreases in\nRMSE from the second-best model for HSI, SSE, and SPX, respectively. Also,\nDCT-MFRFNN outperforms MFRFNN in all experiments.\n",

In\nthis paper, we consider the problem of building a flexible and adaptive\ncontroller for a challenging agile mobile manipulation task of hitting ground\nstrokes on a wheelchair tennis robot. We propose and evaluate an extension to\nwork done on learning striking behaviors using a probabilistic movement\nprimitive (ProMP) framework by (1) demonstrating the safe execution of learned\nprimitives on an agile mobile manipulator setup, and (2) proposing an online\nprimitive refinement procedure that utilizes evaluative feedback from humans on\nthe executed trajectories.\n",

Herein, a global neural network\npotential (GNNP) is developed to provide direct theoretical understandings by\nperforming long-time and large-size atomic simulations. We propose a\nself-consistent picture as follows: (i) CoO$_2$ layers are easier to glide with\nlonger distances at more highly delithiated states, resulting in structural\ntransitions and structural inhomogeneity; (ii) at regions between different\nphases with different Li distributions due to gliding, local strains are\ninduced and accumulate during cycling processes; (3) accumulated strains cause\nthe rupture of Li diffusion channels and result in formation of oxygen dimers\nduring cycling especially when Li has inhomogeneous distributions, leading to\ncapacity degradations and safety issues. We find that large tensile strains\ncombined with inhomogeneous distributions of Li ions play critical roles in the\nformation processes of blocked Li diffusion channels and the oxygen dimers at\nhigh-delithiation states, which could be the fundamental origins of capacity\ndegradations and safety issues.

        "original_csv_abstract": "  Many complex engineering systems consist of multiple subsystems that are\ndeveloped by different teams of engineers. To analyse, simulate and control\nsuch complex systems, accurate yet computationally efficient models are\nrequired. Modular model reduction, in which the subsystem models are reduced\nindividually, is a practical and an efficient method to obtain accurate\nreduced-order models of such complex systems. However, when subsystems are\nreduced individually, without taking their interconnections into account, the\neffect on stability and accuracy of the resulting reduced-order interconnected\nsystem is difficult to predict. In this work, a mathematical relation between\nthe accuracy of reduced-order linear-time invariant subsystem models and\n(stability and accuracy of) resulting reduced-order interconnected linear\ntime-invariant model is introduced. This result can subsequently be used in two\nways. Firstly, it can be used to translate accuracy characteristics of the\nreduced-order subsystem models directly to accuracy properties of the\ninterconnected reduced-order model. Secondly, it can also be used to translate\nspecifications on the interconnected system model accuracy to accuracy\nrequirements on subsystem models that can be used for fit-for-purpose reduction\nof the subsystem models. These applications of the proposed analysis framework\nfor modular model reduction are demonstrated on an illustrative structural\ndynamics example.\n",

The energy levels of quantum dot (QD) array and\nthe band structure of its hydrogenated counterpart are coupling for both 2DH\nsystems of C and Si.

We demonstrate how network topology capacitates an adversary to\ninfluence age scaling in a network. We show that in a fully connected network,\na single infected node increases the expected age from $O(\\log n)$ to $O(n)$.\nFurther, we show that the optimal behavior for an adversary is to reset the\ntimestamps of all outgoing packets to the current time and of all incoming\npackets to an outdated time for the infected node; thereby preventing any fresh\ninformation to go into the infected node, and facilitating acceptance of stale\ninformation out of the infected node into other network nodes. Lastly for fully\nconnected network, we show that if an infected node contacts only a single node\ninstead of all nodes of the network, the system age can still be degraded to\n$O(n)$. These show that fully connected nature of a network can be both a\nbenefit and a detriment for information freshness; full connectivity, while\nenabling fast dissemination of information, also enables fast dissipation of\nadversarial inputs. We then analyze the unidirectional ring network, the other\nend of the network connectivity spectrum, where we show that the adversarial\neffect on age scaling of a node is limited by its distance from the adversary,\nand the age scaling for a large fraction of the network continues to be\n$O(\\sqrt{n})$, unchanged from the case with no adversary. We finally support\nour findings with simulations.\n",

Although booming with a vast number of emerging methods and\ntechniques, most of the literature is built on the in-distribution hypothesis,\ni.e., testing and training graph data are identically distributed. However,\nthis in-distribution hypothesis can hardly be satisfied in many real-world\ngraph scenarios where the model performance substantially degrades when there\nexist distribution shifts between testing and training graph data. To solve\nthis critical problem, out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization on graphs,\nwhich goes beyond the in-distribution hypothesis, has made great progress and\nattracted ever-increasing attention from the research community. In this paper,\nwe comprehensively survey OOD generalization on graphs and present a detailed\nreview of recent advances in this area. First, we provide a formal problem\ndefinition of OOD generalization on graphs. Second, we categorize existing\nmethods into three classes from conceptually different perspectives, i.e.,\ndata, model, and learning strategy, based on their positions in the graph\nmachine learning pipeline, followed by detailed discussions for each category.\nWe also review the theories related to OOD generalization on graphs and\nintroduce the commonly used graph datasets for thorough evaluations. Finally,\nwe share our insights on future research directions. This paper is the first\nsystematic and comprehensive review of OOD generalization on graphs, to the\nbest of our knowledge.\n",

        "original_csv_abstract": "  In the last years, the number of IoT devices deployed has suffered an\nundoubted explosion, reaching the scale of billions. However, some new\ncybersecurity issues have appeared together with this development. Some of\nthese issues are the deployment of unauthorized devices, malicious code\nmodification, malware deployment, or vulnerability exploitation. This fact has\nmotivated the requirement for new device identification mechanisms based on\nbehavior monitoring. Besides, these solutions have recently leveraged Machine\nand Deep Learning techniques due to the advances in this field and the increase\nin processing capabilities. In contrast, attackers do not stay stalled and have\ndeveloped adversarial attacks focused on context modification and ML/DL\nevaluation evasion applied to IoT device identification solutions. This work\nexplores the performance of hardware behavior-based individual device\nidentification, how it is affected by possible context- and ML/DL-focused\nattacks, and how its resilience can be improved using defense techniques. In\nthis sense, it proposes an LSTM-CNN architecture based on hardware performance\nbehavior for individual device identification. Then, previous techniques have\nbeen compared with the proposed architecture using a hardware performance\ndataset collected from 45 Raspberry Pi devices running identical software. The\nLSTM-CNN improves previous solutions achieving a +0.96 average F1-Score and 0.8\nminimum TPR for all devices. Afterward, context- and ML/DL-focused adversarial\nattacks were applied against the previous model to test its robustness. A\ntemperature-based context attack was not able to disrupt the identification.\nHowever, some ML/DL state-of-the-art evasion attacks were successful. Finally,\nadversarial training and model distillation defense techniques are selected to\nimprove the model resilience to evasion attacks, without degrading its\nperformance.\n",

However, despite the many\napplications of VQCs, there are still questions to be answered, such as for\nexample: What is the best sequence of gates to be used? How to optimize their\nparameters? Which cost function to use? How the architecture of the quantum\nchips influences the final results? In this article, we focus on answering the\nlast question. We will show that, in general, the cost function will tend to a\ntypical average value the closer the parameterization used is from a\n$2$-design. Therefore, the closer this parameterization is to a $2$-design, the\nless the result of the quantum neural network model will depend on its\nparametrization. As a consequence, we can use the own architecture of the\nquantum chips to defined the VQC parametrization, avoiding the use of\nadditional swap gates and thus diminishing the VQC depth and the associated\nerrors.\n",

We propose\na pessimism-based algorithm, dubbed as pessimistic minimax value iteration\n(PMVI), which overcomes the distributional shift by constructing pessimistic\nestimates of the value functions for both players and outputs a policy pair by\nsolving NEs based on the two value functions. Furthermore, we establish a\ndata-dependent upper bound on the suboptimality which recovers a sublinear rate\nwithout the assumption on uniform coverage of the dataset. We also prove an\ninformation-theoretical lower bound, which suggests that the data-dependent\nterm in the upper bound is intrinsic. Our theoretical results also highlight a\nnotion of \"relative uncertainty\", which characterizes the necessary and\nsufficient condition for achieving sample efficiency in offline MGs.

In contrast to existing CBF-based\nmethods for high-relative degree constraints, our approach involves choosing\nexplicitly specified gains (instead of class $\\mathcal{K}$ functions), and,\nwith the aid of backstepping, operates in the entirety of the original safe set\nwith no additional restriction on the initial conditions. With Quadratic\nProgramming (QP) being employed in the design, in addition to backstepping and\nCBFs with a PTSf property, we refer to our design as a QP-backstepping PT-CBF\ndesign. For illustration, we include a simulation for the double-integrator\nsystem.\n",

These universal rules have been established within the framework of\nlinear wave transport, where nonlinear interactions are omitted, and are\ndescribed using Random Matrix Theory (RMT). Here, using a nonlinear complex\nnetwork of coaxial cables (graphs), we exploit both experimentally and\ntheoretically the interplay of nonlinear interactions and wave chaos. We\ndevelop general theories that describe our asymmetric transport (AT)\nmeasurements, its universal bound, and its statistical description via RMT.\nThese are controlled by the structural asymmetry factor (SAF) characterizing\nthe structure of the graph. The SAF dictates the asymmetric intensity range\n(AIR) where AT is strongly present. Contrary to the conventional wisdom that\nexpects losses to deteriorate the transmittance, we identify (necessary)\nconditions for which the AIR (AT) increases without deteriorating the AT (AIR).\nOur research initiates the quest for universalities in wave transport of\nnonlinear chaotic systems and has potential applications for the design of\nmagnetic-free isolators.\n",

It is not trying to\nsolve the full-fledged constrained minimization problem composed from the\nmodeling constraints and the chosen objective function. Rather, the task is to\nfind a feasible point which is \"superior\" (in a well-defined manner) with\nrespect to the objective function, to one returned by a feasibility-seeking\nonly algorithm. We telegraphically review the superiorization methodology and\nwhere it stands today and propose a rigorous formulation of its, yet only\npartially resolved, guarantee problem. The real-world situation in an\napplication field is commonly represented by constraints defined by the\nmodeling process and the data, obtained from measurements or otherwise dictated\nby the model-user. The feasibility-seeking problem requires to find a point in\nthe intersection of all constraints without using any objective function to aim\nat any specific feasible point. At the heart of the superiorization methodology\nlies the modeler desire to use an objective function, that is exogenous to the\nconstraints, in order to seek a feasible solution that will have lower (not\nnecessarily minimal) objective function value. This aim is less demanding than\nfull-fledged constrained minimization but more demanding than plain\nfeasibility-seeking. Putting emphasis on the need to satisfy the constraints,\nbecause they represent the real-world situation, one recognizes the \"asymmetric\nroles of feasibility-seeking and objective function reduction\", namely, that\nfulfilling the constraints is the main task while reduction of the exogenous\nobjective function plays only a secondary role.

However, the energy storage and release could not be\nwell-timed yet. On the contrary, for multi-link systems, the natural system\ndynamics might even work against the actual goal. With the introduction of\nvariable stiffness actuators, this problem has been partially addressed. With a\nsuitable optimal control strategy, the approximate decoupling of the motor from\nthe link can be achieved to maximize the energy transfer into the distal link\nprior to launch. However, such continuous stiffness variation is complex and\ntypically leads to oscillatory swing-up motions instead of clear launch\nsequences. To circumvent this issue, we investigate decoupling for speed\nmaximization with a dedicated novel actuator concept denoted Bi-Stiffness\nActuation. With this, it is possible to fully decouple the link from the joint\nmechanism by a switch-and-hold clutch and simultaneously keep the elastic\nenergy stored. We show that with this novel paradigm, it is not only possible\nto reach the same optimal performance as with power-equivalent variable\nstiffness actuation, but even directly control the energy transfer timing. This\nis a major step forward compared to previous optimal control approaches, which\nrely on optimizing the full time-series control input.\n",

In this work, we\npropose a robust deformable generative network for unsupervised font generation\n(abbreviated as DGFont++). We introduce a feature deformation skip connection\n(FDSC) to learn local patterns and geometric transformations between fonts. The\nFDSC predicts pairs of displacement maps and employs the predicted maps to\napply deformable convolution to the low-level content feature maps. The outputs\nof FDSC are fed into a mixer to generate final results. Moreover, we introduce\ncontrastive self-supervised learning to learn a robust style representation for\nfonts by understanding the similarity and dissimilarities of fonts. To\ndistinguish different styles, we train our model with a multi-task\ndiscriminator, which ensures that each style can be discriminated\nindependently. In addition to adversarial loss, another two reconstruction\nlosses are adopted to constrain the domain-invariant characteristics between\ngenerated images and content images. Taking advantage of FDSC and the adopted\nloss functions, our model is able to maintain spatial information and generates\nhigh-quality character images in an unsupervised manner.

        "original_csv_abstract": "  A gapless liquid state can have many different emergent symmetries, which can\nbe viewed as invariants or fingerprints of the gapless state. The emergent\nsymmetries can be anomaly-free (classified by groups or higher groups),\nanomalous (classified by groups plus group cocycles), or even beyond group and\nbeyond anomalous. To understand all those emergent symmetries in an unified\nway, it is better to put all the emergent symmetries of the state together, and\nrefer to the maximal emergent symmetry as maximal categorical symmetry. A\nsystematic understanding of those emergent symmetries is achieved after\nrealizing that categorical symmetry is nothing but (non-invertible)\ngravitational anomaly, which is the same as topological order in one higher\ndimension if the categorical symmetry is finite. The above description of\nmaximal categorical symmetry is just a vague idea. In this paper, we propose a\nprecise way to define the notion of maximal categorical symmetry. For example,\nthe 1+1D Ising critical point has a maximal categorical symmetry described by\nthe 2+1D doulbe-Ising topological order. Such a categorical symmetry is not\nassociated to any anomaly-free symmetry. The maximal categorical symmetry is a\nvery detailed characterization of the gapless state (much more than the\nprojective symmetry group introduced before for the same purpose). It may be\nclose to the full characterization of the local low energy properties of\ngapless liquid state. Therefore, the study of maximal categorical symmetry may\nbe a key to gaining a systematic understanding or even a classification of\ngapless liquid states, up to local low energy equivalence, where two gapless\nstates are local low energy equivalent if they differ by stacking a gapped\nstate.\n",

Subgraph reasoning with message passing is a\npromising and popular solution. Some recent methods have achieved good\nperformance, but they (i) usually can only predict triples involving unseen\nentities alone, failing to address more realistic fully inductive situations\nwith both unseen entities and unseen relations, and (ii) often conduct message\npassing over the entities with the relation patterns not fully utilized. In\nthis study, we propose a new method named RMPI which uses a novel Relational\nMessage Passing network for fully Inductive KGC. It passes messages directly\nbetween relations to make full use of the relation patterns for subgraph\nreasoning with new techniques on graph transformation, graph pruning,\nrelation-aware neighborhood attention, addressing empty subgraphs, etc., and\ncan utilize the relation semantics defined in the ontological schema of KG.\nExtensive evaluation on multiple benchmarks has shown the effectiveness of\ntechniques involved in RMPI and its better performance compared with the\nexisting methods that support fully inductive KGC. RMPI is also comparable to\nthe state-of-the-art partially inductive KGC methods with very promising\nresults achieved. Our codes and data are available at\nhttps://github.com/zjukg/RMPI.\n",

As it is well known that cellular networks have been considered\nas the primary infrastructure for M2M communications, there are several key\nissues to be addressed in order to deploy M2M communications over cellular\nnetworks. Notably, the rapid growth of M2M traffic dramatically increases\nenergy consumption, as well as degrades the performance of existing\nHuman-to-Human (H2H) traffic. Sustainable operation technology and resource\nmanagement are efficacious ways for solving these issues. In this paper, we\ninvestigate a resource management problem in cellular networks with H2H/M2M\ncoexistence. First, considering the energy-constrained nature of machine type\ncommunication devices (MTCDs), we propose a novel network model enabled by\nsimultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), which empowers\nMTCDs with the ability to simultaneously perform energy harvesting (EH) and\ninformation decoding. Given the diverse characteristics of IoT devices, we\nsubdivide MTCDs into critical and tolerable types, further formulating the\nresource management problem as an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem\nunder divers Quality-of-Service (QoS) constraints. Then, we develop a\nmulti-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based scheme to solve this\nproblem. It provides optimal spectrum, transmit power and power splitting (PS)\nratio allocation policies, along with efficient model training under designed\nbehaviour-tracking based state space and common reward function. Finally, we\nverify that with a reasonable training mechanism, multiple M2M agents\nsuccessfully work cooperatively in a distributed way, resulting in network\nperformance that outperforms other intelligence approaches in terms of\nconvergence speed and meeting the EE and QoS requirements.\n",

Because the diagram mainly consists of simple\nlines and color blocks, its visual features are sparser than those of natural\nimages. In addition, diagrams usually express diverse knowledge, in which there\nare many low-frequency object categories in diagrams. These lead to the fact\nthat traditional data-driven detection model is not suitable for diagrams. In\nthis work, we propose a gestalt-perception transformer model for diagram object\ndetection, which is based on an encoder-decoder architecture. Gestalt\nperception contains a series of laws to explain human perception, that the\nhuman visual system tends to perceive patches in an image that are similar,\nclose or connected without abrupt directional changes as a perceptual whole\nobject. Inspired by these thoughts, we build a gestalt-perception graph in\ntransformer encoder, which is composed of diagram patches as nodes and the\nrelationships between patches as edges. This graph aims to group these patches\ninto objects via laws of similarity, proximity, and smoothness implied in these\nedges, so that the meaningful objects can be effectively detected. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that the proposed GPTR achieves the best\nresults in the diagram object detection task. Our model also obtains comparable\nresults over the competitors in natural image object detection.\n",

Their occurrence is often\nassociated with tectonic tremor and slow-slip events along the plate boundary\nin subduction zones and occasionally transform fault zones. They are usually\ngrouped into families, with all the earthquakes of a given family originating\nfrom the same small patch on the plate interface and recurring more or less\nepisodically in a bursty manner. In this study, we extend the LFE catalog\nobtained by Plourde et al. (2015) during an episode of high tremor activity in\nApril 2008, to the 8-year period 2004-2011. All of the tremor in the Boyarko et\nal. (2015) catalog south of 42 degrees North has associated LFE activity, but\nwe have identified several smaller episodes of LFEs without associated tremor\nactivity, and extend their catalog forward and backward by a total of about 3\nyears. As in northern Cascadia, the down-dip LFE families have recurrence\nintervals several times smaller than the up-dip families. For the April 2008\nEpisodic Tremor and Slip event, the best recorded LFE families exhibit a strong\ntidal Coulomb stress sensitivity starting 1.5 days after the rupture front\npasses by each LFE family. The southernmost LFE family, which has been\ninterpreted to be on the subduction plate boundary, near the up-dip limit of\ntremor, has a very short recurrence time. Also, these LFEs tend to occur during\ntimes when predicted tidal Coulomb stress is discouraging slip on the plate\nboundary. Both observations suggest this LFE family may be on a different\nfault.\n",

To avoid performance decrease caused by forgetting,\nprior studies exploit episodic memory (EM), which stores a subset of the past\nobserved samples while learning from new non-i.i.d. data. Despite the promising\nresults, since CL is often assumed to execute on mobile or IoT devices, the EM\nsize is bounded by the small hardware memory capacity and makes it infeasible\nto meet the accuracy requirements for real-world applications. Specifically,\nall prior CL methods discard samples overflowed from the EM and can never\nretrieve them back for subsequent training steps, incurring loss of information\nthat would exacerbate catastrophic forgetting. We explore a novel hierarchical\nEM management strategy to address the forgetting issue. In particular, in\nmobile and IoT devices, real-time data can be stored not just in high-speed\nRAMs but in internal storage devices as well, which offer significantly larger\ncapacity than the RAMs. Based on this insight, we propose to exploit the\nabundant storage to preserve past experiences and alleviate the forgetting by\nallowing CL to efficiently migrate samples between memory and storage without\nbeing interfered by the slow access speed of the storage. We call it Carousel\nMemory (CarM). As CarM is complementary to existing CL methods, we conduct\nextensive evaluations of our method with seven popular CL methods and show that\nCarM significantly improves the accuracy of the methods across different\nsettings by large margins in final average accuracy (up to 28.4%) while\nretaining the same training efficiency.\n",

With the development of adversarial generative models, high-quality\nforgery images become more and more indistinguishable from real to humans.\nExisting methods always regard as forgery detection task as the common binary\nor multi-label classification, and ignore exploring diverse multi-modality\nforgery image types, e.g. visible light spectrum and near-infrared scenarios.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Forgery Classifier for\nMulti-modality Face Forgery Detection (HFC-MFFD), which could effectively learn\nrobust patches-based hybrid domain representation to enhance forgery\nauthentication in multiple-modality scenarios. The local spatial hybrid domain\nfeature module is designed to explore strong discriminative forgery clues both\nin the image and frequency domain in local distinct face regions. Furthermore,\nthe specific hierarchical face forgery classifier is proposed to alleviate the\nclass imbalance problem and further boost detection performance. Experimental\nresults on representative multi-modality face forgery datasets demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of the proposed HFC-MFFD compared with state-of-the-art\nalgorithms.

In this\nwork, we performed a systematic study of Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods for\nestimating uncertainty in segmentation neural networks.\n  Methods: We evaluated Bayes by Backprop, Monte Carlo Dropout, Deep Ensembles,\nand Stochastic Segmentation Networks in terms of segmentation accuracy,\nprobability calibration, uncertainty on out-of-distribution images, and\nsegmentation quality control.\n  Results: We observed that Deep Ensembles outperformed the other methods\nexcept for images with heavy noise and blurring distortions. We showed that\nBayes by Backprop is more robust to noise distortions while Stochastic\nSegmentation Networks are more resistant to blurring distortions. For\nsegmentation quality control, we showed that segmentation uncertainty is\ncorrelated with segmentation accuracy for all the methods. With the\nincorporation of uncertainty estimates, we were able to reduce the percentage\nof poor segmentation to 5% by flagging 31--48% of the most uncertain\nsegmentations for manual review, substantially lower than random review without\nusing neural network uncertainty (reviewing 75--78% of all images).\n  Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive evaluation of uncertainty\nestimation methods and showed that Deep Ensembles outperformed other methods in\nmost cases.\n  Significance: Neural network uncertainty measures can help identify\npotentially inaccurate segmentations and alert users for manual review.\n",

In\nparticular, we consider stochastic systems with additive noise, whose\ndistribution lies in an ambiguity set of distributions that are\n$\\varepsilon-$close to a nominal one according to the Wasserstein distance. For\nthis class of systems, we derive control synthesis algorithms that are robust\nagainst all these distributions and maximize the probability of satisfying a\nreach-avoid specification. The framework we present first learns an abstraction\nof a switched stochastic system as a robust Markov decision process (robust\nMDP) by accounting for both the stochasticity of the system and the uncertainty\nin the noise distribution. Then, it synthesizes a strategy on the resulting\nrobust MDP that maximizes the probability of satisfying the property and is\nrobust to all uncertainty in the system. This strategy is then refined into a\nswitching strategy for the original stochastic system. By exploiting tools from\noptimal transport and stochastic programming, we show that synthesizing such a\nstrategy reduces to solving a set of linear programs, thus guaranteeing\nefficiency. We experimentally validate the efficacy of our framework on various\ncase studies, including both linear and non-linear switched stochastic systems.\n",

        "original_csv_abstract": "  The $f(R)$ Modified Gravity is a modification of Einstein's general theory of\nrelativity, which aims to explain issues beyond The Standard Model of Cosmology\nsuch as dark energy and dark matter. As a theory of gravitation that govern\nmajor dynamics on the large scale of the universe, an $ f(R)$ model should be\nable to explain the transition from a matter-dominated universe to a\ndark-energy-dominated universe. Assuming that the density parameter of the\nradiation can be neglected during the transition from a matter-dominated\nuniverse to a dark-energy-dominated universe, we find some fixed points\nregarding the dynamical stability of the density parameters of the model. The\nphase transition can be achieved if the $f(R)$ model can connect the fixed\npoint $P_5$ (representing the matter-dominated era) to the fixed point $P_1$\n(representing the dark energy-dominated era). The method to evaluate that state\ntransition is called the Fixed-point analysis. In this study, we analyze the\nviability of $f(R)$ models proposed by Starobinsky, Hu-Sawicki, and\nGogoi-Goswami regarding the phase transition from a matter-dominated universe\nto a dark-energy-dominated universe. It is shown that those models are viable\nby choosing some set of appropriate parameters. For example, in the Starobinsky\nand Hu-Sawicki models, the parameter $\\mu$ can be chosen to correspond to the\nlower bound of $x_d= R_1/Rc$, where $R_1$ represents the de-Sitter point.\nMeanwhile, for the Gogoi-Guswami model, the same results can be achieved by\ntaking $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ parameters satisfying the existence and stability\nconditions for the de-Sitter point. From these results, it can be concluded\nthat those $f(R)$ models allow such phase transitions of the universe to\nrealize the late-time accelerated expansion.\n",

Traditional\nstatistical methods cannot handle whole-genome mutation data due to their\nultra-high-dimensionality and extreme data sparsity -- e.g., >30 million unique\nvariants are observed in the ~1700 whole-genome tumor dataset considered\nherein, of which >99% variants are encountered only once. To harness\ninformation in these rare variants we have recently proposed the \"hidden genome\nmodel\", a formal multilevel multi-logistic model that mines information in\nultra-rare somatic variants to characterize tumor types. The model condenses\nsignals in rare variants through a hierarchical layer leveraging contexts of\nindividual mutations. The model is currently implemented using consistent,\nscalable point estimation techniques that can handle 10s of millions of\nvariants detected across thousands of tumors. Our recent publications have\nevidenced its impressive accuracy and attributability at scale. However,\nprincipled statistical inference from the model is infeasible due to the\nvolume, correlation, and non-interpretability of the mutation contexts.

Previous numerical studies have found that the equilibrium\nof a coronal flux rope system could be disrupted if the axial magnetic flux of\nthe rope exceeds a critical value, so that the catastrophe occurs, initiating\nthe flux rope to erupt. Further studies discovered that the catastrophe does\nnot necessarily exist: the flux rope system with certain photospheric flux\ndistributions could be non-catastrophic. It is noteworthy that most previous\nnumerical studies are under the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) condition, so\nthat it is still elusive whether there is the catastrophe associated with the\ncritical axial flux if magnetic reconnection is included in the flux rope\nsystem. In this paper, we carried out numerical simulations to investigate the\nevolutions of coronal magnetic rope systems under the ideal MHD and the\nresistive condition. Under the ideal MHD condition, our simulation results\ndemonstrate that the flux rope systems with either too compact or too weak\nphotospheric magnetic source regions are non-catastrophic versus varying axial\nflux of the rope, and thus no eruption could be initiated; if there is magnetic\nreconnection in the rope system, however, those flux rope systems could change\nto be capable of erupting via the catastrophe associated with increasing axial\nflux. Therefore, magnetic reconnection could significantly influence the\ncatastrophic behaviors of flux rope system. It should be both the magnetic\ntopology and the local physical parameters related to magnetic reconnection\nthat determine whether the increasing axial flux is able to cause flux rope\neruptions.\n",

Moreover, the\nnondegenerate Karush-Kuhn-Tucker points of the corresponding Scholtes-type\nregularization converge to a T-stationary point having the same index, i.e. its\ntopological type persists.

It is\ncritical in a number of sequential decision making problems ranging from\nhealthcare to technology industries. Most of the work in existing literature is\nfocused on evaluating the mean outcome of a given policy, and ignores the\nvariability of the outcome. However, in a variety of applications, criteria\nother than the mean may be more sensible. For example, when the reward\ndistribution is skewed and asymmetric, quantile-based metrics are often\npreferred for their robustness. In this paper, we propose a doubly-robust\ninference procedure for quantile OPE in sequential decision making and study\nits asymptotic properties. In particular, we propose utilizing state-of-the-art\ndeep conditional generative learning methods to handle parameter-dependent\nnuisance function estimation. We demonstrate the advantages of this proposed\nestimator through both simulations and a real-world dataset from a short-video\nplatform. In particular, we find that our proposed estimator outperforms\nclassical OPE estimators for the mean in settings with heavy-tailed reward\ndistributions.\n",

The data streams are\nfurther processed and fused into a 3D model of the subject using a tablet\nlocated on the robot. In addition, an automatic selection method, based on our\nspecific system configurations, is proposed to select the head portion. We\nevaluated the accuracy of the proposed system by comparing our generated 3D\nhead models, from both standard human head model and real human subjects, with\nthe ones reconstructed from FastSCAN and Cyberware commercial laser scanning\nsystems through computing and visualizing Hausdorff distances.

This problem becomes increasingly challenging with\nmultiple interacting RO in such investments. We propose a scalable machine\nlearning based RO framework for multi-period sequential service region design &\ntiming problem for mobility-on-demand services, framed as a Markov decision\nprocess with non-stationary stochastic variables. A value function\napproximation policy from literature uses multi-option least squares Monte\nCarlo simulation to get a policy value for a set of interdependent investment\ndecisions as deferral options (CR policy). The goal is to determine the optimal\nselection and timing of a set of zones to include in a service region. However,\nprior work required explicit enumeration of all possible sequences of\ninvestments. To address the combinatorial complexity of such enumeration, we\npropose a new variant \"deep\" RO policy using an efficient recurrent neural\nnetwork (RNN) based ML method (CR-RNN policy) to sample sequences to forego the\nneed for enumeration, making network design & timing policy tractable for large\nscale implementation. Experiments on multiple service region scenarios in New\nYork City (NYC) shows the proposed policy substantially reduces the overall\ncomputational cost (time reduction for RO evaluation of > 90% of total\ninvestment sequences is achieved), with zero to near-zero gap compared to the\nbenchmark. A case study of sequential service region design for expansion of\nMoD services in Brooklyn, NYC show that using the CR-RNN policy to determine\noptimal RO investment strategy yields a similar performance (0.5% within CR\npolicy value) with significantly reduced computation time (about 5.4 times\nfaster).\n",

To address\nthis problem, we offer an alternative account of the epistemic contribution of\ndeduction as the process required to deduce a conclusion or a theorem,\nunderstanding such process not only in terms of the number of steps in the\nderivation but, more importantly, the reason for or justification for every\nstep.

Routing approaches for deformable\nobjects which rely on learned implicit spatial representations (e.g.,\nLearning-from-Demonstration methods) make them vulnerable to changes in the\nenvironment and the specific setup. On the other hand, algorithms that entirely\nseparate the spatial representation of the deformable object from the routing\nand manipulation, often using a representation approach independent of\nplanning, result in slow planning in high dimensional space.\n  This paper proposes a novel approach to routing deformable one-dimensional\nobjects (e.g., wires, cables, ropes, sutures, threads). This approach utilizes\na compact representation for the object, allowing efficient and fast online\nrouting. The spatial representation is based on the geometrical decomposition\nof the space into convex subspaces, resulting in a discrete coding of the\ndeformable object configuration as a sequence. With such a configuration, the\nrouting problem can be solved using a fast dynamic programming sequence\nmatching method that calculates the next routing move. The proposed method\ncouples the routing and efficient configuration for improved planning time. Our\nsimulation and real experiments show the method correctly computing the next\nmanipulation action in sub-millisecond time and accomplishing various routing\nand manipulation tasks.\n",

We consider a thick braneworld scenario in the higher-dimensional extension of this gravity, and investigate the torsion effects on the brane structure and gravitational perturbation. For three particular parameter choices, analytic domain wall solutions are obtained. They have a similar brane configuration that the brane thickness becomes thinner …",
