Different solutions are being tested and trialled around the world, especially in India. They key driving factor for reducing digital divide is exploring different solutions both technologically and economically to lower the cost for the network deployments and improving service adoption rate. In this survey, we aim to study the rural connectivity use-cases, state of art projects and initiatives, challenges, and technologies to improve digital connectivity in rural parts of India. The strengths and weakness of different technologies which are being tested for rural connectivity is analyzed. We also explore the rural use-case of 6G communication system which would be suitable for rural Indian scenario.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "Automated decision systems (ADS) are increasingly used for consequential decision-making. These systems often rely on sophisticated yet opaque machine learning models, which do not allow for understanding how a given decision was arrived at. In this work, we conduct a human subject study to assess people's perceptions of informational fairness (i.e., whether people think they are given adequate information on and explanation of the process and its outcomes) and trustworthiness of an underlying ADS when provided with varying types of information about the system. More specifically, we instantiate an ADS in the area of automated loan approval and generate different explanations that are commonly used in the literature. We randomize the amount of information that study participants get to see by providing certain groups of people with the same explanations as others plus additional explanations. From our quantitative analyses, we observe that different amounts of information as well as people's (self-assessed) AI literacy significantly influence the perceived informational fairness, which, in turn, positively relates to perceived trustworthiness of the ADS. A comprehensive analysis of qualitative feedback sheds light on people's desiderata for explanations, among which are (i) consistency (both with people's expectations and across different explanations), (ii) disclosure of monotonic relationships between features and outcome, and (iii) actionability of recommendations.",

In a previous work, Khot and Moshkovitz suggested an inefficient candidate reduction (i.e., without a proof of soundness). The current work is the first to provide an efficient reduction along with a proof of soundness. The non-unique game we reduce from is similar to non-unique games for which PCP theorems are known. Our proof relies on a new concentration theorem for functions in Gaussian space that are restricted to a random hyperplane. We bound the typical Euclidean distance between the low degree part of the restriction of the function to the hyperplane and the restriction to the hyperplane of the low degree part of the function.",

We design an optimal test for this problem which gives rise to a message-passing algorithm for graph alignment, which provably returns in polynomial time a positive fraction of correctly matched vertices, and a vanishing fraction of mismatches. With an average degree $\\lambda = O(1)$ in the graphs, and a correlation parameter $s \\in [0,1]$, this result holds with $\\lambda s$ large enough, and $1-s$ small enough, completing the recent state-of-the-art diagram. Tighter conditions for determining whether partial graph alignment (or correlation detection in trees) is feasible in polynomial time are given in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergences.",

However, these GPS datasets may contain users' private information (e.g., home location), preventing many users from sharing their private information with a third party. Hence, identifying travel modes while protecting users' privacy is a significant issue. To address this challenge, we use federated learning (FL), a privacy-preserving machine learning technique that aims at collaboratively training a robust global model by accessing users' locally trained models but not their raw data. Specifically, we designed a novel ensemble-based Federated Deep Neural Network (eFedDNN). The ensemble method combines the outputs of the different models learned via FL by the users and shows an accuracy that surpasses comparable models reported in the literature. Extensive experimental studies on a real-world open-access dataset from Montr\u00e9al demonstrate that the proposed inference model can achieve accurate identification of users' mode of travel without compromising privacy.",

OTA-FL exploits the superposition property of the wireless medium, and performs model aggregation over the air for free. Thus, it can greatly reduce the communication cost incurred in communicating model updates from the edge devices. In order to fully utilize this advantage while providing comparable learning performance to conventional federated learning that presumes model aggregation via noiseless channels, we consider the joint design of transmission scaling and the number of local iterations at each round, given the power constraint at each edge device. We first characterize the training error due to such channel noise in OTA-FL by establishing a fundamental lower bound for general functions with Lipschitz-continuous gradients. Then, by introducing an adaptive transceiver power scaling scheme, we propose an over-the-air federated learning algorithm with joint adaptive computation and power control (ACPC-OTA-FL). We provide the convergence analysis for ACPC-OTA-FL in training with non-convex objective functions and heterogeneous data. We show that the convergence rate of ACPC-OTA-FL matches that of FL with noise-free communications.",

The mechanism is controlled by tuning parameters, which can be tuned according to a specific risk or utility metric. Thus expected properties of synthetic data sets can be determined analytically a priori, that is, before they are generated. While [4] considered the case of generating m = 1 data set, this paper considers generating m > 1 data sets. In effect, m becomes a tuning parameter and the role of m in relation to the risk-utility trade-off can be shown analytically. The paper introduces a pair of risk metrics, tau(3)(k, d) and tau(4)(k, d), that are suited to m > 1 data sets; and also considers the more general issue of how best to analyse m > 1 categorical data sets: average the data sets pre-analysis or average results post-analysis. Finally, the methods are demonstrated empirically with the synthesis of a constructed data set which is used to represent the English School Census.",

In fact, the possibility of accurately and reliably predicting the RUL of a system, based on a record of its monitoring data, can allow users to schedule maintenance interventions before faults occur. In the recent literature, several data-driven methods for RUL prediction have been proposed. However, most of them are based on traditional (connectivist) neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks, and alternative mechanisms have barely been explored. Here, we tackle the RUL prediction problem for the first time by using a membrane computing paradigm, namely that of Spiking Neural P (in short, SN P) systems. First, we show how SN P systems can be adapted to handle the RUL prediction problem. Then, we propose the use of a neuro-evolutionary algorithm to optimize the structure and parameters of the SN P systems. Our results on two datasets, namely the CMAPSS and new CMAPSS benchmarks from NASA, are fairly comparable with those obtained by much more complex deep networks, showing a reasonable compromise between performance and number of trainable parameters, which in turn correlates with memory consumption and computing time.",

We propose implicit in time numerical schemes for both the original system and its symmetrized form. As in the continuous framework, the numerical analysis is based on the reformulation of the PDE system using the set of entropic variables. The equivalence of both schemes allows to establish a discrete entropy inequality and consequently an priori estimates. As a by-product, existence of solutions to the schemes is proved by means of a Leray-Schauder argument. Numerical evidences allow to compare the performances of both schemes on the test case of a 2D ballistic diode.",

To further embody the details of information and better conform to situations of real world, a Markov model is introduced into the generalized evidence theory which helps extract complete information volume from evidence provided. More specially, the Markov model investigates influences on properties of information given which are brought by dynamic process of transitions among different incidents and provides new solutions in evidence combination, distance measure, reliability measure, and certainty measure. Besides, some numerical examples are offered to verify the correctness and rationality of the proposed method in these relevant aspects.",

Among others, it implements the two-photon production of lepton pairs previously introduced in LPAIR. As a proof of principle, we show that the two approaches are numerically consistent. The k(T)-factorized description of this process is also handled, along with the two-photon production of a quark, or a W-+/- gauge boson pair. This toolbox may be used as a common framework for the definition of many other processes following this approach. Additionally, photoproduction and other photon induced processes are also considered, or being implemented. Program summary Program title: CepGen CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/24jg665g65.1 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/cepgen/cepgen Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License 3 Programming language: C++/Python External routines/libraries: GSL [1] for MC integration and histogramming, optional wrappers for LHAPDF [2] for the partonic proton structure functions evaluation, or ROOT [3], Delphes [4] for the output treatment. Nature of problem: The simulation of central exclusive, and in particular two-photon induced processes is becoming increasingly topical given its potential source of contamination for electroweak studies and resonance searches at LHC and future colliders. However, most of simulation tools available are only accounting for the production of photons collinear to the incoming proton beams. Legacy codes such as LPAIR, have however shown their effectiveness in predicting such processes at LHC energies. Unfortunately, they are barely maintained nor maintainable with modern computing infrastructures. Solution method: CepGen provides a modern implementation of legacy photon-induced matrix elements (gamma gamma -> l(+)l(-), and W+ W-, with more to be added), including standard e(+) e(-), or ppbeams (both elastic and dissociative final beam states for the latter). For the modern implementation of LPAIR, it inherits from the former fine treatment of the low-|t| region accounting for a large fraction of the cross section. It also introduces a general wrapping framework to define new photon-induced and diffractive processes, either in C++ or in Fortran. This wrapper provides the k(T) factorization procedure for 2 -> 4 process computation, and a highly flexible 2 -> N process placeholder. A user-defined taming of the matrix element is also included to study the effect of kinematic variables-dependent survival factors observed experimentally. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: Depending on the complexity of the central process, memory and CPU time. Currently event generation runs only in single-threaded mode, development ongoing to support multi-threading. (C) 2021 The Author. Published by Elsevier B.V.",

Humanistic knowledge building communities (HKBCs) are a growth promoting pedagogy, suitable to address these challenges. Yet, the way that students\u2019 identities as knowledge builders are transformed remains undertheorized. In this study, we rise above existing frameworks of fixedness versus fluidity to elucidate how students develop growth orientations. Using a grounded approach, we examined a graduate course, coding 322 relevant utterances that were expressed by the course participants over the semester. This resulted in a five dimensional framework of fixedness versus growth that was used to describe the personal transformation of students within the HKBC. The changes that students made over time were shown to occur at statistically significant levels. This study suggests that learning communities should focus on the complementary nature of collective idea-advancement and personal growth promotion if they are to address the challenges of preparing students for life in a rapidly changing world.",

We proposed an analytic framework of measures for assessing collaboration quality in a wiki-based collaborative learning environment, covering student contribution, participation, transactivity, and social dynamics. Based on this framework, we designed an LA-enabled group awareness tool, Wikiglass, for use by both teachers and students in K-12 schools for visualizing statistics of students\u2019 input and interactions on wikis at the class, group, and individual levels. Adopting a naturalistic design, this study allowed teachers and students to decide whether and how often to use the tool.

Regression analyses of quantitative data and thematic content analysis of interview responses showed relationships between the frequencies of teachers\u2019 and students\u2019 use of Wikiglass and measures of students\u2019 collaboration quality at both the individual and group levels. These results indicate that teachers\u2019 scaffolding, students\u2019 collaboration styles, and ethical issues must all be considered when implementing collaborative learning approaches for secondary education.

Thus, there is a pressing need for socio-political pedagogies and designs in CSCL to empower students as cultural-historical agents who can communicate and work effectively across different communities. As the initial steps of our larger efforts to conceptualize and operationalize a model of multicultural collaborative competence (MCC), we explore communication patterns associated with productive and dysfunctional shared meaning-making around difficult topics related to identity (e.g., race, gender) during intergroup dialogues in a CSCL context. We also examine how our preexisting, general model of collaborative competence (GCC) aligns with these communication patterns to explore (1) whether GCC is robust enough to capture the socio-political dynamics of difficult dialogues and (2) the ways in which we could modify it to better address the tensions between GCC and MCC goals. We collected the discussion transcripts of four three-person teams over two-time points from an undergraduate Multicultural Psychology course. We first conducted thematic and cross-case analyses to identify the communication patterns and behaviors associated with productive and dysfunctional shared meaning-making processes in the context of difficult dialogues (i.e., MCC). We then employed another set of cross-case analyses to examine the relationship between the multicultural collaborative competencies (MCC) and general collaborative competencies (GCC). We found four main communication patterns associated with MCC: (1) grounding with narratives and aims, (2) exploring differences and commonalities of narratives/perspectives, (3) critical reflection of diverse narratives/perspectives, and (4) providing emotional support to team members.

        "original_csv_abstract": "Analyzing correlated data by goodness-of-fit type tests is a critical statistical problem in many applications. A unified framework is provided through a general family of goodness of-fit tests (GGOF) to address this problem. The GGOF family covers many classic and newly developed tests, such as the minimal p-value test, Simes test, the GATES, onesided Kolmogorov-Smirnov type tests, one-sided phi-divergence tests, the generalized Higher Criticism, the generalized Berk-Jones, etc. It is shown that the omnibus test that automatically adapts among GGOF statistics for given data, i.e., the GGOF-O, is still contained in the GGOF family and is computationally efficient. For analytically controlling the type I error rate of any GGOF tests, exact calculation is deduced under the Gaussian model with positive equal correlations. Based on that, the effective correlation coefficient (ECC) algorithm is proposed to address arbitrary correlations. Simulations are used to explore how signal and correlation patterns jointly influence typical GGOF tests' statistical power. The GGOF-O is shown robustly powerful across various signal and correlation patterns. As demonstrated by a study of bone mineral density, the GGOF framework has good potential for detecting novel disease genes in genetic summary data analysis.

A common exploratory data analysis task is to infer robust statistical associations between high-dimensional microbial compositions and habitat- or host-related covariates. To address this, a general robust statistical regression framework RobRegCC (Robust Regression with Compositional Covariates) is proposed, which extends the linear log-contrast model by a mean shift formulation for capturing outliers. RobRegCC includes sparsity-promoting convex and non-convex penalties for parsimonious model estimation, a data-driven robust initialization procedure, and a novel robust cross-validation model selection scheme. The procedure is implemented in the R package robregcc. Extensive simulation studies show the RobRegCC's ability to perform simultaneous sparse log-contrast regression and outlier detection over a wide range of settings. To demonstrate the seamless applicability of the workflow to real data, the gut microbiome dataset from HIV patients are analyzed and robust associations between a sparse set of microbial species and host immune response from soluble CD14 measurements are inferred.

        "original_csv_abstract": "Hypothesis testing is a central statistical method in the biomedical sciences. The ongoing debate about the concept of statistical significance and the reliability of null hypothesis significance tests (NHST) and p-values has brought the advent of various Bayesian hypothesis tests as possible alternatives, which often employ the Bayes factor. However, careful calibration of the prior parameters is necessary for the type I error rates or power of these alternatives to be any better. Also, the availability of various Bayesian tests for the same statistical problem leads to the question which test to choose based on which criteria. Recently proposed Bayesian nonparametric two-sample tests are analyzed with regard to their type I error rates and power to detect an effect. Results show that approaches vary substantially in their ability to control the type I and II errors, and it is shown how to select the prior parameters to balance power and type I error control. This allows for prior elicitation and power analyses based on objective criteria like type I and II error rates even when conducting a Bayesian nonparametric two-sample test. Also, it is shown that existing nonparametric Bayesian two-sample tests are adequate only to test for location-shifts. Together, the results provide guidance how to perform a nonparametric Bayesian two-sample test while simultaneously improving the reliability of research. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The increased vehicle usage increases the requirement of efficient group communication between the vehicles to support the safety as well as the non-safety applications in Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANET). In VANET, multicast communication is mostly preferred for the effective utilization of computational resources and the attainment of the Quality of Service (QoS). To implement an efficient multicast communication, we need to build and retain a multicast tree. Due to the high mobility and rapid topology changes, the formation and maintenance of a multicast tree are challenging in VANET. Existing multicast communication techniques are either centralized or location-based flooding and suffer from tree reconfiguration overhead. In this paper, a novel Distributed Treebased Multicast Routing (DTMR) algorithm is proposed. During the link failure, the connection is switched to a predetermined and highly stable guardian node. Further, the tree fragmentation and the rejoining delay is reduced in VANET using the proposed algorithm, DTMR. From the simulation results, it is evident that the DTMR achieves a significant performance improvement against the existing multicast techniques such as Distributed Time-limited Reliable Broadcast Incremental Power Strategy (DTRBIP) and Energy Efficient Multicast routing protocol based on Software Defined Networks and Fog computing for Vehicular networks (EEMSFV) in terms of delay, packet loss ratio, scalability, and reliability. In terms of end-to-end delay, packet loss rate, and reliability, the DTMR outperforms the existing DTRBIP and EEMSFV protocols. DTMR achieves 94-96% reliability in highway scenarios and 96-99% reliability in urban environments. Further, as a proof of concept, the proposed, DTMR is implemented and analyzed in real-time. It is found that the real-time experimental results are on par with the simulation results. Hence, the proposed DTMR achieves network stability and reliability in real-time.",

Generally, these networks have different limitations such as control node election, data aggregation, load balancing during data collection etc. The load balancing depends on the effective routing techniques which provide an optimum path to transmit the data such that the minimum amount of energy should be consumed. The control nodes are responsible for assigning the task and data transmission in the cluster-based routing techniques and the selection of the control node is an NP-hard problem. To resolve this problem, an adaptive particle swarm optimization (PSO) ensemble with genetic mutation-based routing is proposed to select control nodes for IoT based software-defined WSN. The proposed algorithm plays a significant role in selecting the control nodes by considering energy and distance parameters. The proposed work is implemented for the heterogeneous networks having different computing power accompanied by single and multiple sinks. The experiment was carried out on the scale of the performance matrix such as fitness value, stability period, average residual energy, etc. The simulation result of the proposed algorithm outperforms over other algorithms under the different arrangements of the network.",

The proposed approach presented here smoothly tackles this problem through use of a developed IoT-based STS solution deployed in solar panels in order to increase solar energy harvesting efficiency. A special IoT-STS component designed and implemented with hardware and software, developed for this purpose, effectively transfers the relative panel position information to the other panel IoT-STSs with the help of wireless and internet communication features in real-time.

A very important work of these schemes is to produce a secret position for every user to store her/his data, which is named secure arrangement.

There are semi-equivelar maps on the torus, the Klein bottle and other surfaces which are not vertex-transitive. It is known that the boundaries of Platonic solids, Archimedean solids, regular prisms and anti-prisms are vertex-transitive maps on S-2.

Two simple measures are defined-rooted depth and relative depth-and their properties are discussed. The method of loop collapse is introduced, allowing investigation of networks containing directed cycles. The behavior of the two depth measures is investigated in Erdos-Renyi random graphs, directed Barabasi-Albert networks, and in Gnutella p2p share network. A clear distinction in the behavior between non-hierarchical and hierarchical networks is found, with random graphs featuring unimodal distribution of depths dependent on arc density, while for hierarchical systems the distributions are similar for different network densities. Relative depth shows the same behavior as existing trophic level measure for tree-like networks, but is only statistically correlated for more complex topologies, including acyclic directed graphs.",

In particular, the same data streams, sampled and stored differently, may cause agents to arrive at different conclusions and to take different actions. This phenomenon has a drastic impact on polities-populations of agents predicated on the sharing of information. We show that, even under ideal conditions, polities consisting of epistemic agents with heterogeneous cognitive architectures might not achieve consensus concerning what conclusions to draw from datastreams. Transfer entropy applied to a toy model of a polity is analyzed to showcase this effect when the dynamics of the environment is known. As an illustration where the dynamics is not known, we examine empirical data streams relevant to climate and show the consensus problem manifest.",

It is not clear what quantifiable relationships public discussions of politics have with official discourse within legislative bodies. In this study we present an analysis of how language used by Members of Parliament (MPs) in the United Kingdom (UK) changes after social media posts and online reactions to those posts. We consider three domains: news articles posted on Facebook in the UK, speeches in the questions-debates in the UK House of Commons, and Tweets by UK MPs. Our method works by quantifying how the words used in one domain become more common in another domain after an event such as a social media post. Our results show that words used in one domain later appear more commonly in other domains. For instance after each article on Facebook, we estimate that on average 4 in 100,000 words in Commons speeches had changed, becoming more similar to the language in the article. We also find that the extent of this language change positively correlates with the number of comments and emotional interactions on Facebook. The observed language change differs between political parties; in particular, changes in word use by Labour MPs are more strongly related to social media content than that of Conservative MPs. We argue that the magnitude of this word flow is quite substantial given the large volume of news articles shared on Facebook. Our method and results quantify how parliamentary attention follows public interest as expressed on Facebook and also indicate how this effect may be stronger for posts which evoke reactions on Facebook associated with laughter or anger.",

The NAS methods utilizing multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are especially useful when the objective is not only to minimize the network error but also to reduce the number of parameters (weights) or power consumption of the inference phase. We propose a multi-objective NAS method based on Cartesian genetic programming for evolving convolutional neural networks (CNN). The method allows approximate operations to be used in CNNs to reduce the power consumption of a target hardware implementation. During the NAS process, a suitable CNN architecture is evolved together with selecting approximate multipliers to deliver the best trade-offs between accuracy, network size, and power consumption. The most suitable 8 \u00d7 N-bit approximate multipliers are automatically selected from a library of approximate multipliers. Evolved CNNs are compared with CNNs developed by other NAS methods on the CIFAR-10 and SVHN benchmark problems.",

PSB1 has been used to make notable progress toward the goal of general program synthesis: automatically creating the types of software that human programmers code. Many of the systems that have attempted the problems in PSB1 have used it to demonstrate performance improvements granted through new techniques. Over time, the suite has gradually become outdated, hindering the accurate measurement of further improvements. The field needs a new set of more difficult benchmark problems to move beyond what was previously possible and ensure that systems do not overfit to one benchmark suite. In this paper, we describe the 25 new general program synthesis benchmark problems that make up PSB2, a new benchmark suite. These problems are curated from a variety of sources, including programming katas and college courses. We selected these problems to be more difficult than those in the original suite, and give results using PushGP showing this increase in difficulty. We additionally give an example of benchmarking using a state-of-the-art parent selection method, showing improved performance on PSB2 while still leaving plenty of room for improvement. These new problems will help guide program synthesis research for years to come.",

Interpretability comes from the need to trust the prediction model, verify some of its properties, or even enforce them to improve fairness. Many model-agnostic explanatory methods exists to provide explanations for black-box models. In the regression task, the practitioner can use white-boxes or gray-boxes models to achieve more interpretable results, which is the case of symbolic regression. When using an explanatory method, and since interpretability lacks a rigorous definition, there is a need to evaluate and compare the quality and different explainers. This paper proposes a benchmark scheme to evaluate explanatory methods to explain regression models, mainly symbolic regression models. Experiments were performed using 100 physics equations with different interpretable and non-interpretable regression methods and popular explanation methods, evaluating the performance of the explainers performance with several explanation measures. In addition, we further analyzed four benchmarks from the GP community. The results have shown that Symbolic Regression models can be an interesting alternative to white-box and black-box models that is capable of returning accurate models with appropriate explanations. Regarding the explainers, we observed that Partial Effects and SHAP were the most robust explanation models, with Integrated Gradients being unstable only with tree-based models. This benchmark is publicly available for further experiments.",

Deep neural networks (DNNs) incorporate the power to learn patterns through data, following an end-to-end fashion and expand the applicability in real world problems, since less pre-processing is necessary. With the fast growth in both scale and complexity, a new challenge has emerged regarding the design and configuration of DNNs. In this work, we present a study on applying an evolutionary grammar-based genetic programming algorithm (GP) as a unified approach to the design of DNNs. Evolutionary approaches have been growing in popularity for this subject as Neuroevolution is studied more. We validate our approach in three different applications: the design of Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification, Graph Neural Networks for text classification, and U-Nets for image segmentation. The results show that evolutionary grammar-based GP can efficiently generate different DNN architectures, adapted to each problem, employing choices that differ from what is usually seen in networks designed by hand. This approach has shown a lot of promise regarding the design of architectures, reaching competitive results with their counterparts.",

Motivated by practical issues from financial regulation, special attention is given to the two most widely used risk measures in the industry, Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES). We establish that for a class of general optimization problems, VaR leads to nonrobust optimizers, whereas convex risk measures generally lead to robust ones. Our results offer extra insight on the ongoing discussion about the comparative advantages of VaR and ES in banking and insurance regulation. Our notion of robustness is conceptually different from the field of robust optimization, to which some interesting links are derived.",

The previous studies either focused on selecting suitable material for the morphing wings or performing experimental tests on UAVs with morphing wings. Though, the dynamic modeling of active flexible morphing wings and their involved interactions with the aerodynamics of the UAV body are challenging subjects. Using such a model to control a small UAV to perform specific maneuvering is not investigated yet. The dynamic model of UAV with active morphing wings generates a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system which rises the difficulty of the control system design. In this paper, the aeroelastic dynamic model of morphing wing activated by piezocomposite actuators is established using the finite element method and modal decomposition technique. Then, the dynamic model of the UAV is developed taking into consideration the coupling between the wing and piezocomposite actuators, as well as the dynamic properties of the morphing actuators with the aerodynamic wind disturbances. A model predictive control (MPC) is designed for the MIMO control system to perform specific flight maneuvering by tracking desired trajectories of UAV altitude and yaw angle. Additionally, the MPC achieves constrained behavior of pitch and roll angles to get satisfactory UAV motion. Also, the behaviors of the UAV control system using MPC are evaluated after adding Dryden wind turbulence to the UAV outputs. Finally, a UAV flight simulation is conducted which shows that the control system successfully rejects the applied disturbances and tracks the reference trajectories with acceptable behavior of pitch and roll angles.",

The high-level task planner is a Reinforcement Learning agent, trained using the information coming from the low-level Motion Planner. In this work we consider the Q-Tree algorithm, which is based on a dynamic tree structure inspired by the Q-learning technique. Three different RL-policies with two kinds of tree exploration techniques (Breadth and Depth) are compared in simulation scenarios with different complexity. Moreover, the proposed learning methods are experimentally validated in a real scenario by adopting a KINOVA Jaco",

Although aerial inspection of transmission lines is a well-researched topic, there is still space for research papers and solutions that focus on shared control, landing, and experimental evaluation of the solutions. This kind of system has the capabilities to acquire and process information about its surrounding. By employing automatic UAVs embedded with artificial intelligence, industries, business and researchers can significantly improve their visual-based inspection routines, bringing safety to the user and processing reliable information. Therefore, this research work proposes a strategy to both detect and track power transmission lines and a method to allow assistive control during UAV landing. Both methods were evaluated in simulated and real-world scenarios. Regarding the detection and tracking strategies, the outcomes suggested that the proposed system is capable of correctly identifying power transmission lines and navigating above them, even in the presence of cluttered backgrounds. Futhermore, the results of the assisted landing strategy showed that the method has excellent performance and is technically viable for practical deployment.",

In addition, we describe efficient methods for decomposing the estimated cross spectral density function into a linear model of coregionalization plus a residual process. The methods are applied to two storm datasets, one of which is from Hurricane Florence, which struck the southeastern United States in September 2018. The application demonstrates how fitted models from different datasets can be compared, and how the methods are computationally feasible on datasets with more than 200,000 total observations.",

Compared with widely used spike-and-slab priors, shrinkage priors have better computational efficiency.

In this paper, we apply global\u2013local shrinkage priors to high-dimensional multivariate linear regression with unknown covariance matrix. We show that when the prior is highly concentrated near zero and has heavy tail, the posterior contraction rates for both coefficients matrix and covariance matrix are nearly optimal. Our results hold when number of features p grows much faster than the sample size n, which is of great interest in modern data analysis. We show that a class of readily implementable scale mixture of normal priors satisfies the conditions of the main theorem.",

Firms decide on the allocation of demand from different sources to different facilities to minimize delay costs and service-fulfillment costs possibly subject to service-level requirements. If firms decide to operate collectively as a coalition, they must also decide on a scheme for sharing the total cost. Academic/practical relevance: We study capacity sharing through demand allocation in service systems in the presence of service-fulfillment costs. Our problem is motivated by service collaboration in healthcare involving public-private partnerships. Methodology: We formulate the problem as a cooperative game and identify a cost allocation that is in the core. Results: The cost-allocation scheme we identify is price-directed, and the cost of each firm consists of three components: (1) the delay cost incurred within the firm; (2) a cost paid for the capacity used by the firm at facilities owned by other firms; and (3) a payment received for fulfilling demand of other firms at facilities owned by the firm. Interestingly, we show that the cost-allocation scheme is equivalent to a market equilibrium-that is, it can be implemented in a decentralized fashion. We extend our analysis to settings where the capacity of each facility is endogenously determined and to settings where a service-priority policy is deployed. Our results are robust to a variety of generalizations: partial sharing, partial transfer, facilities modeled as general queueing systems, and convex delay costs. Managerial implications: Our findings provide guidelines for and insights into how to carry out demand allocation and cost sharing among different firms in the presence of service-fulfillment costs to foster service collaboration. In particular, the equilibrium market prices can be viewed as the prices/subsidies for service collaboration in a public-private partnership.",

This setting drops rational expectations along the \u2018common knowledge of rationality and market clearing\u2019 (CKRMC) assumptions, and, in particular, it drops the Radner (1979) price model and price inference assumptions. Unaware agents are shown to face an incompressible uncertainty over future states and prices, represented by a so-called \u201dminimum uncertainty set\u201d. A sequential equilibrium obtains when agents expect the \u2018true\u2019 price as a possible outcome on every spot market, and elect optimal market-clearing strategies. This so-called \u201dcorrect foresight equilibrium\u201d (CFE) is shown to exist whenever agents\u2019 anticipation sets include the minimum uncertainty set. When the CKRMC assumptions are restored, the CFE is shown to lead to an overarching concept of rational expectations equilibrium, which generalizes the classical concepts.",

Then, contextual attention is applied to utilize the texture information of background regions to generate the final result. Although using region normalization can improve the performance and quality of the network, it often results in visible color shifts. To solve this problem, we introduce perceptual color distance in the loss function. In quantitative comparison experiments, the proposed method is superior to the existing similar methods in Inception Score, Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance, and perceptual color distance.

Unlike most of the structural models used in the literature, our new model assumes that the default will occur only if the price of the reference asset stays below a certain level for a pre-described period of time. To work out the corresponding CDS price, a general pricing formula containing the unknown no-default probability is derived first. It is then shown that the determination of such a probability is equivalent to the valuation of a Parisian or Parasian down-and-out binary options, depending on how the time is recorded. After the option price is solved with a theta finite difference scheme, the CDS price is obtained through the derived general pricing formula. Finally, some numerical experiments are carried out to study the effects of the new default mechanics on the CDS prices.",

At the same time, the models of information diffusion on the Internet are changing as well. However, these models experience the problem due to the fast development of network technologies. There is no thorough research in regards to the latest models and their applications and advantages. As a result, it is essential to have a comprehensive study of information diffusion models. The primary goal of this research is to provide a comparative study on the existing models such as the Ising model, Sznajd model, SIR model, SICR model, Game theory and social networking services models. We discuss several of their applications with the existing limitations and further categorizations. Vulnerabilities and privacy challenges of information diffusion models are extensively explored. Furthermore, categorization including strengths and weaknesses are discussed. Finally, limitations and recommendations are suggested with diverse solutions for the improvement of the information diffusion models and envisioned future research directions. (c) 2019 The Authors.

In this paper, the authors first provided a comprehensive analysis on the IoT communication strategies and applications for smart devices based on a systematic literature review. Then, the communication strategies and applications are categorized into four main topics including device-to-device, device-to-cloud, device-to-gateway, and device-to-application scenarios. Furthermore, a technical taxonomy is presented to classify the existing papers according to search-based methodology in the scientific databases. The technical taxonomy presents five categories for IoT communication applications including monitoring-based communications, routing-based communications, health-based communications, intrusion-based communications, and resource-based communications. The evaluation factors and infrastructure attributes are discussed based on some technical questions. Finally, some new challenges and forthcoming issues of future IoT communications are presented.",

Owing to such huge volume, it becomes very complicated to ensure effective analysis by the existing techniques. The complications can be related to analyze, capture, sharing, storage, and visualization of the data. To tackle these challenges, a novel classification technique using Holoentropy based Correlative Naive Bayes classifier and MapReduce Model (HCNB-MRM) is proposed. The proposed HCNB, which is designed by combining the Holoentropy function with the correlative based Naive Bayes classifier deals with both high-dimensional data sets as well as extensive datasets to improve the benchmark, and classify the data based on dependent assumption. Therefore, the proposed HCNB-MRM is used to make the process simpler and to choose the best features from big dataset. The proposed HCNB with the MapReduce Model maximizes the performance of big data classification using probability index table, and posterior probability of the testing data samples. The performance of the proposed HCNB-MRM is evaluated using three metrics, such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. From the experimental results, it is analyzed that the proposed HCNB-MRM obtains a high classification accuracy of 93.5965% and 94.3369% for the localization dataset, and skin dataset when compared with the existing techniques.",

Just as the interaction between magnetic materials are due to the magnetic field around the magnet contacting another magnet, between the quanta can also interact with each other through magnetic fields. Through the study of quantum mechanics and related theories of brain science, the article puts forward the following viewpoints: between quantum, which has entanglement state, cannot only interact through magnetic fields but also generate quantum induction fields to generate quantum induction waves. The entangled quantum generated spin waves are connected to each other based on quantum inductive waves to form a quantum inductive network. Then, the information is transmitted through resonance to realize the communication between all things. Thus, all things in the universe can be interconnected based on quantum entanglement effects. By analyzing the construction mode of the internet network, the paper proposes the architecture of the quantum induction communication system and the basic topology of a quantum induction internet network. Several thought experiment schemes were designed, and the information transmission between the ordinary objects and between the people and ordinary objects is studied as an example. The analysis points out the main problems faced by the construction of the quantum induction internet. It points out that the significance of constructing of the network of All things interconnect based on quantum entanglement effect is that all living bodies and nonliving bodies in the heaven and earth can be connected and communicate with each other.",

Based on the trusted execution environment (TEE) technology, Intel Software Guard eXtension (SGX) is a practical remedy to user privacy, which employs hardware-assisted enclave to wrap the sensitive data, preventing them from the disclosure. However, the application performance is hurt due to the CPU-expensive and frequent operations on the enclave creation and destruction. In this paper, we propose SGXPool, an application-level framework of resource management to relieve the above issue. SGXPool first uses a preallocated resource pool to assign/revoke the enclave on demand and avoids its cost of dynamical creation and destruction. Then, SGXPool utilizes another resource pool to constrain the threading overhead such as thread initialization, scheduling, and destruction. In addition, SGXPool exposes the simple and clear interface, allowing users or programmers to apply SGXPool without any intrusive modifications on the original SGX application. We implement SGXPool in the typical web servers which use the multithreading to handle the concurrent user requests. The evaluation results show that SGXPool can improve the performance of the original multithreading system up to 19 times. Meanwhile, the original security of SGX is maintained.",

Deploying edge computing servers in small base stations (SBSs), operators make profit by offering MUs with computing services, while MUs purchase services to solve their own computation tasks quickly and energy-efficiently. In this context, it is of particular importance to optimize computing resource allocation and computing service pricing in each SBS, subject to its limited computing and communication resources. To address this issue, we formulate an optimization problem of computing resource management and trading in small-cell networks and tackle this problem using a two-tier matching. Specifically, the first tier targets at the association algorithm between MUs and SBSs to achieve maximum social welfare, and the second tier focuses on the collaboration algorithm among SBSs to make efficient usage of limited computing resources. We further show that the two proposed algorithms contribute to stable matchings and achieve weak Pareto optimality. In particular, we verify that the first algorithm arrives at a competitive equilibrium. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms can achieve a better network social welfare than baseline algorithms while retaining a close-optimal performance.",

To bridge these research gaps, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of DTN performance in Mars-Earth communications, considering a realistic and complex end-to-end scenario, where multiple assets and multiple data flows are involved, as envisioned for future space missions.

With this system, a video camera is installed on the road, and calibration is used to obtain the projection equation of the actual road on the image plane. Several image processing techniques, such as background modeling, background extraction, edge detection, and object tracking, are used to develop and implement a prototype system. The proposed system also uses a transfer learning process that is more efficient than starting CNN from scratch. This maximizes training efficiency and increases prediction accuracy in vehicle classification. Preliminary experimental results demonstrate that multiple vehicle tracking and classification are possible while calculating vehicle speed. The ultimate goal of this study is to develop a single digital video camera system with embedded machine learning process that can monitor and distinguish multiple vehicles simultaneously in multiple lanes.",

Accordingly, this paper introduces the trust-based topology-hiding multipath routing algorithm for the MANET. The proposed model finds the security factor of each node in the MANET, and the neighbor nodes are selected based on the defined security factor. The proposed routing method has four models for defining the security factor, namely the trusted model, energy model, delay model, and the mobility model. The proposed multipath routing determines the secured route between the sender and receiver based on the selected neighbor nodes. Finally, data communication is performed through the selected multipath. The performance of the proposed multipath routing is analyzed with the existing methods, such as topology-hiding multipath routing protocol, Fractional lion optimization to topology-hiding multi-path routing, and Adaptive Fractional lion optimization to topology-hiding multi-path routing for the performance metrics, such as throughput, delay, energy, and packet drop rate (PDR). Simulation results show that the proposed multipath routing has the better values of 0.330566, 0.376754, 0.319369, and 0.380559 after 50 s of simulation for throughput, delay, energy, and PDR than the existing models when there is an attack on the node.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "In public vehicles, one of the major concerns is driver's level of expertise for its direct proportionality to safety of passengers. Hence, before a driver is subjected to certain type of vehicle, he should be thoroughly evaluated and categorized with respect to certain parameters instead of only one-time metric of having driving license. These aspects may be driver's expertise, vigilance, aptitude, experience years, cognition, driving style, formal education, terrain, region, minor violations, major accidents, and age group. The purpose of this categorization is to ascertain suitability of a driver for certain vehicle type(s) to ensure passengers' safety. Currently, no driver categorization technique fully comprehends the implicit as well as explicit characteristics of drivers dynamically. In this paper, machine learning-based dynamic and adaptive technique named D-CHAITs (driver categorization through hybrid of artificial intelligence techniques) is proposed for driver categorization with an objective focus on driver's attributes modeled in DriverOntology. A supervised mode of learning has been employed on a labeled dataset, having diverse profiles of drivers with attributes pertinent to drivers' perspectives of demographics, behaviors, expertise, and inclinations. A comparative analysis of D-CHAIT with three other machine learning techniques (fuzzy logic, case-based reasoning, and artificial neural networks) is also presented. The efficacy of all techniques was empirically measured while categorizing the drivers based on their profiles through metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure performance, and associated costs. These empirical quantifications assert D-CHAIT as a better technique than contemporary ones. The novelty of proposed technique is signified through preprocessing of feature attributes, quality of data, training of machine learning model on more relevant data, and adaptivity.",

Consequently, system losses are continually raised while the voltage profile is reduced. This paper presents a novel hybrid method to determine the best locations and sizes of single and multiple of different renewable distributed energy resources (DER). The presented hybrid method is based on Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) and combined power loss sensitivity (CPLS). Integration of photovoltaics (PV) and wind turbines (WT) in distribution network is used to enhance the system voltage, minimize system losses and increase the system capacity. The effect of annual load growth in system load and system operating constraints are taken in consideration. IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus radial distribution systems (RDS) are used to validate the presented algorithm for integrating the DERS in distribution system. In addition, the presented algorithm is compared with different recent optimization algorithms in order to prove its effectiveness and superiority. (c) 2019 The Authors.

Among the various areas of such technologies, software evolution and maintenance are essential yet challenging tasks both for research and in practice. In particular, for large-scale software, the maintenance costs are often much more than the development cost. In order to help to resolve this issue, software module clustering approaches have been studied to build adequate modules with high cohesion and low coupling; such modular structures can help the comprehension and maintenance of complex systems. The existing studies apply either structural, semantic, or historic-based factors as clustering criteria; however, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study considers Graphical User Interface (GUI) as a factor for software module clustering. Because GUI is linked to the functionalities of a software system, it can be a useful source to find cohesive modules and generate well-defined modular structures. Thus, in this study, we propose a GUI-based approach for software module clustering to improve the quality of software modularization. Quantitative and qualitative experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach and comparing it with three existing approaches; using two open source software systems. The evaluation results show that our proposed approach generates feasible software modules and provides closer estimates to actual modularization than those of the existing approaches.",

A logarithmic type imputation technique has been developed to reduce the nuisance effect of non-response in sample surveys. Utilizing information available on a highly positively or highly negatively correlated auxiliary variable, a logarithmic type estimator is proposed and its properties, including bias and mean square error, are discussed. An optimal replacement policy has been derived, and effect of measurement errors on the mean square error of the estimator has been studied. Empirical studies have been carried out using both real and simulated data, and suitable recommendations have been put forward to the survey statisticians for applications in real life problems.",

Because of the mobile nature of the UE, the D2D link tends to fail more often. In order to guarantee seamless proximity service (ProSe) continuity for the mobile devices, a competent mobility management technique is necessary. In this work, an optimal D2D handover (HO) scheme in LTE heterogeneous network is proposed for guaranteeing seamless ProSe continuity for the UE in D2D communication. The proposed optimal D2D HO scheme tries to improve the duration of D2D communication by not only considering the signal quality between the D2D UE pairs but also the distance between them. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves the D2D mode duration, even in high mobility, thereby reducing frequent HO of the D2D UE, which is in D2D communication.",

However, the nature of the Arabic cursive script poses extra challenges that need further investigation. Therefore, having a reliable and efficient Arabic OCR system that is independent of font variations is highly required. In this paper, an indirect, font-in dependent word and character segmentation algorithm for printed Arabic text investigated. The proposed algorithm takes a binary line image as an input and produces a set of binary images consisting of one character or ligature as an output. The segmentation performed at two levels: a word segmentation performed in the first level, by employing a vertical projection at the input line image along with using Interquartile Range (IQR) method to differentiate between word gaps and within word gaps. A projection profile method used as a second level of segmentation along with a set of statistical and topological features, which are font-independent, to identify the correct segmentation points from all potential points. The APTI dataset used to test the proposed algorithm with a variety of font type, size, and style. The algorithm experimented on 1800 lines (approximately 24,816 words) with an average accuracy of 97.7% for words segmentation and 97.51% for characters segmentation. (c) 2019 The Authors.

        "original_csv_abstract": "In this paper, we present a new multibiometric fusion method for the identification of persons using two modalities, the iris and the fingerprint. Each modality is separately processed to generate a vector of scores. The fusion method is applied at the score level. A preliminary study based on the k-means clustering method, for each modality, led us to split the score range into three zones of interest relevant to the proposed identification method. The fusion is then applied to the extracted regions using two approaches. The first one achieves the classification by the decision tree combined to the weighted sum (BCC), while the second approach is based on the fuzzy logic (BFL). Several tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods on standard biometric databases using four metrics, namely, False Accept Rate, False Reject Rate, Enrollee False Accept Rate and Recognition Rate. The obtained results are very interesting since they illustrate clearly that the proposed fusion approaches outperform those based on a single modality. In addition, we showed that the BCC fusion approach achieves slightly better performance compared to the BFL. (c) 2019 The Authors.

The Bayes estimators are derived with gamma prior and evaluated under squared error loss function. It is known that the censored observations create the complexity in Bayes estimation procedures. Therefore, two approximation techniques, namely Tierney-Kadane approximation method and Markov Chain Monte Carlo method have been used to compute the approximate Bayes estimators. The proposed estimates are compared with the usual maximum likelihood estimators through Monte Carlo simulations. Lastly, a medical data set has been considered to show the applicability of the proposed model as well study in real life scenario.",

On the other hand, even though distance and online learning has become mainstream, there are still concerns leveled at many of these educational offerings, one of them being the relative social isolation of online and distance students. In this study, we investigate if and how ambient awareness, a concept originated in research in interpersonal effects of SNS, can play an important role in how salient social impressions of peers emerge and how this leads to perceptions of social presence among students. To this end, we use an impression formation paradigm in a four-week online distance course (N = 51). We found that students were able to form impressions of their peers through ambient awareness. These impressions differed in prevalence from the ones gathered through direct social interaction. In a larger second sample (N = 169), we find ambient awareness to be a mediator between the sociability of the learning environment and perceptions of social presence. Implications, limitations and suggestions for further research are discussed.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "As the global data traffic has significantly increased in the recent year, the ultra-dense deployment of cellular networks (UDN) is being proposed as one of the key technologies in the fifth-generation mobile communications system (5G) to provide a much higher density of radio resource. The densification of small base stations could introduce much higher inter-cell interference and lead user to meet the edge of coverage more frequently. As the current handover scheme was originally proposed for macro BS, it could cause serious handover issues in UDN i.e. ping-pong handover, handover failures and frequent handover. In order to address these handover challenges and provide a high quality of service (QoS) to the user in UDN. This paper proposed a novel handover scheme, which integrates both advantages of fuzzy logic and multiple attributes decision algorithms (MADM) to ensure handover process be triggered at the right time and connection be switched to the optimal neighbouring BS. To further enhance the performance of the proposed scheme, this paper also adopts the subtractive clustering technique by using historical data to define the optimal membership functions within the fuzzy system. Performance results show that the proposed handover scheme outperforms traditional approaches and can significantly minimise the number of handovers and the ping-pong handover while maintaining QoS at a relatively high level.",

Traditional data mining techniques are not fit to process big data. Predictive analytics has grown in prominence alongside the emergence of big data. In this paper, an efficient predictive analytics system for high dimensional big data is proposed by enhancing scalable random forest (SRF) algorithm on the Apache Spark platform. SRF is enhanced by optimizing the hyperparameters and prediction performance is improved by reducing the dimensions. The effectiveness of the proposed system is examined on five real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed system achieves the highly competitive performance compared with RF algorithm implemented by Spark MLlib. (c) 2019 The Authors.

The unobservable variable is distorted in a additive fashion by an observed confounding variable. Firstly, a direct plug-in estimation procedure is proposed to calibrate the unobserved variable. Next, we propose four test statistics for testing whether the unobserved variable is symmetric or not. The asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and test statistics are investigated. We conduct Monte Carlo simulation experiments to examine the performance of the proposed estimators and test statistics. These methods are applied to analyze a real dataset for an illustration.",

The participants were pre-service teachers who had registered for a school-based curriculum development methodology course in China, with a total of 53 students from two classes, who performed a total of 1,599 behaviors in the discussion sections. The results show that the concepts of \"evaluate\" (31.52%) and \"analyze\" (27.77%) were the two most frequent behaviors in the Bloom's Taxonomy. The \"remember\" and \"evaluate\" were the significant starting behaviors for all of the students; \"remember\" and \"evaluate\" were the significant starting behaviors for the intuitive-style students, while \"understand\" was a significant starting behavior for the analytical-style students. This confirms that the students with different cognitive styles implemented multiple strategies for learning. It is also found that the flipped learning promoted the students' achievement. The conclusions suggest that it is important to match the cognitive styles of students as well as the instructional methods in order to improve students' learning.",

With a better document clustering approach, computers can organize a document corpus automatically to a meaningful cluster for enabling efficient navigation, and browsing of the corpus. Document navigation and browsing is a valuable complement to the deficiencies of information retrieval technologies. This paper introduces Modsup-based frequent itemset and Rider Optimization-based Moth Search Algorithm (Rn-MSA) for clustering the documents. At first, the input documents are given to the pre-processing step, and then, the extraction is carried out based on TF-IDF and Wordnet features. Once the extraction is done, the feature selection is carried out based on frequent itemset for the establishment of feature knowledge. At last, the document clustering is done using the proposed Rn-MSA, which is designed by combining Rider Optimization Algorithm (ROA), and the Moth Search Algorithm (MSA). The performance of the document clustering based on proposed Modsup\u202f+\u202fRn-MSA is evaluated in terms of precision, recall, F-Measure, and accuracy. The developed document clustering method achieves the maximal precision of 95.90%, maximal recall of 96.41%, maximal F-Measure of 96.41%, and the maximal accuracy of 95.12% that indicates its superiority.",

This flexible lifetime distribution generalizes both the Cauchy Birnbaum-Saunders distribution and the two-parameter Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. In this comparison paper, we discuss maximum likelihood estimation methods for the parameters of this distribution. We numerically illustrate and examine the performances of all discussed methods using extensive Monte Carlo simulations and illustrative examples.

It should be noted that one of the prominent factors in resource management is accurate traffic prediction based on a few data points and within a short time period. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is a suitable model to predict traffic in short time periods. However, it requires a massive amount of historical data to achieve accurate results. On the other hand, the fuzzy regression model is adequate for prediction using less historical data. Aforementioned by these considerations, in this paper, a combination of ARIMA and fuzzy regression called fuzzy autoregressive integrated moving average (FARIMA) is used to forecast traffic in cloud computing. Besides, we adopt the FARIMA model by using the sliding window, called SOFA, concept to determine models with higher prediction accuracy. Accuracy comparison of these models based on the root means square error and coefficient of determination demonstrates that SOFA is about 5.4 and 0.009, respectively, which is the superior model for traffic prediction.",

In the common era of information and technology, the consumers expect the required amount of energy to be present at anytime. This energy is obtained through renewable and nonrenewable resources. Smart wind energy is the idea of efficient energy generation utilizing the wind while satisfying green expectations. However, the random characteristics caused by various external factors have significant effects on wind speeds, thus introducing difficulties in power systems operations and energy generation. Forecasting techniques can be effectively used to predict future wind speeds and power generation to optimize the energy output. The objective of this study is to provide a framework for a local smart-city wind energy harvesting model. Our study evaluates wind speed forecasting models based on synced weather characteristics (air temperature, humidity, and pressure), against models based on wind speed data itself. The produced models are implemented via k-nearest neighbors and linear regression. Two different data sets are addressed for performance comparison purposes. The first one is 5 years of 10-minute time span measurements at Middle East Technical University campus. The second data set is 3 years of the same time span at a site in California, USA. The accuracy of predictions is found to be higher for the data sets with lower variance (METU data set). However, the models fit the higher variance (NREL data set) data better than the lower one.",

To allocate task to their corresponding resource, particle swarm-based optimization algorithm (PSO) is used. In proposed scheme, first independent task selected based on load feed-back, cluster the requested task using MCFCMA and schedule task to each virtual machine. VM selects parallel execution in virtual machine manager. Calculate feature value using PSO algorithm. Allocate resource to the task. Since our proposed system selects resource based on parallel execution, it reduces load balancing in Cloud Quantum Computation (CQC). The proposed system overcomes issues in load balancing and load scheduling; this can be proved by its precision and privacy calculation.",

Critical values are obtained with the Monte Carlo method for sample sizes and at a significance level The power of several normality tests for a wide collection of alternative distributions is calculated. Alternative distributions are divided into 12 groups according to their skewness and excess kurtosis. The second aim is to propose a similarity measure between the normal distribution and an alternative distribution. The third aim is to propose two new alternative distributions created in order to obtain the desired values of skewness and excess kurtosis.

The distributions considered arise from three different categories: symmetric short-tailed, symmetric long-tailed and asymmetric. In addition, power is calculated for several contaminated alternatives. As a direct consequence of this study, we recommend a two-tier approach: (i) observe the shape of the empirical data distribution using graphical methods, then (ii) select an appropriate test based on the likely distributional shape and the corresponding sample size. In general, with respect to power considerations, it is observed that for asymmetric distributions, the Shapiro-Wilk and Ryan-Joiner tests perform fairly well for all sample sizes studied here. Additionally, the Jarque-Bera, Modified Jarque-Bera, and Ryan-Joiner tests perform fairly well for contaminated normal distributions.

The gathered information must be transmitted to the health care center without affecting the quality of data because its quality issue leads to create the packet drop, transmission throughput, maximum energy consumption, and delay. Hence, this paper develop the optimized routing protocol called bacterial bee swarm-based hybrid lifetime maximization large-scale mobile ad hoc routing protocol for performing data transmission process.

The statistician would like to control the overall error rate relative to draw statistically valid conclusions from each test. The familywise error rate (FWE) metric and the hypothesis test procedure while controlling both the type I and II FWEs are generalized by an arbitrarily varying object. The characteristics of logarithmically asymptotically optimal (LAO) hypotheses testing are studied. The purpose of research is to express the optimal functional relation among the reliabilities of LAO hypotheses testing and to judge with FWE metric.",

Aiming at the quality prediction of parts in the production process, a product quality prediction model is established. In this model, Rough Set (RS), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) are applied to solve the problem of product quality prediction and a RS-PSO-LSSVM synthesis algorithm is established. First, the 5M1E analysis of production process for parts is carried out, and the index system of influencing factors is established. Based on this index system, the condition attributes and decision attributes of RS are determined, in which RS is used to the reduction to extract rules and the optimal condition attribute value is obtained, which is used as the pre-processing of LSSVM input data. Second, in order to improve the learning and generalization ability of LSSVM, PSO is used to optimize the relevant parameters and find the optimal solution. Finally, an example is given to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the product quality prediction model and the RS-PSO-LSSVM comprehensive algorithm established above, and the prediction accuracy is higher than that of the RS-LSSVM algorithm.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "The Analects of Confucius has been identified as an important and influential philosophy around the globe. However, in traditional instruction, it is difficult to express the spirit of this philosophy. Therefore, many students consider it as a big challenge to study the Analects of Confucius. To cope with this problem, in this study, an interactive e-book system has been developed based on the contextual learning model to interpret the Analects of Confucius in an interactive way. A quasi-experiment was conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The participants were 38 fifth graders from 2 classes in an elementary school located in northern Taiwan, who were divided into an experimental and a control group. The experimental group used an interactive e-book learning mode to learn the Analects of Confucius course while the control group used a conventional technology enhanced teaching mode. The results showed that adopting the interactive e-book teaching mode to study the Analects of Confucius in the elementary school course can promote students' learning achievement and motive. It was also found that the interactive e-book learning mode can trigger learners' deep motive, and hence promote their learning achievement.",

The aim of this study is to explore whether university students' information searching behaviours, task completion times, and task completion rates in simple and difficult tasks differ depending on information searching experience and cognitive style. The study was conducted with a sample of 20 university students. The results of this study indicated that in difficult search tasks, online information searching experience is influential on the exhibition of online information searching behaviours associated with the metacognitive domain. In simple and difficult tasks, experience and cognitive styles cause differentiation in online information searching behaviours. When task complexity is taken as a basis, the experience is more influential on task completion time and task completion rate compared to cognitive styles.",

However, studies investigating online discussions in recent years have shown that off-topic messaging has increased with the use of social network services. Thus, determining the design of a mechanism to reduce the frequency of off-topic messaging is an issue deserving attention. This study develops a Facebook-based system and employs two strategies (a filter reminder strategy and a self-reflection strategy) aiming to reduce off-topic messaging in comparative and empirical studies. The research questions are as follows: (a) Which strategy is more effective in reducing off-topic messaging? (b) What are the influences of the strategies on the patterns of students' cognitive processes? and (c) Does this influence occur during discussions? The results indicate that the filter reminder strategy can not only reduce off-topic messaging but also elicit more diversified cognitive behaviors. Finally, based on the findings, this study provides suggestions for future research and advice regarding instruction.",

To assess the performance of the proposed half-spectral models, we conduct two simulations, in which we compare the proposed fitting approach with respect to the other classical estimation methods. The proposed methods have great success in fitting parametric space-time covariance functions specifically for massive data sets. Finally, we apply the proposed methods for a real daily wind speed data in Iran.",

Producing such accurate results for detection of dyslexia from a dataset which consist of low-quality dataset and the presence of vague information is the toughest challenge among researchers. This paper aims at developing an evolving model to handle the impreciseness in the detection of dyslexia more intelligently. In this work, each instance is described in a neutrosophic domain by defining a membership degree of truthiness, indeterminacy, and falsity. These instances are neutrosophically clustered by applying Neutrosophic C-Means clustering (NCM) which forms four different clusters namely dyslexia, no dyslexia, control/revision and hyperactivity or other issues. The outlier and noise are the special categories of indeterminacy which often occurs in real datasets are promptly discovered and clustered. NCM is optimized by introducing Artificial Bacterial Foraging (ABF), especially when there is vagueness or imprecision in the selection of cluster centroids. With the merits of global searching, ABF selects more promising clustering during cluster re-computation. The interpreted results confirm that the role played by proposed ONCMC-ABF algorithm produces better results in the prediction of dyslexia with the low-quality dataset.",

In fact, they proved a more general result in terms of variable degeneracy. Inspired by these results and DP-coloring which is a generalization of list coloring and has become a widely studied topic, we introduce a generalization on variable degeneracy including list vertex arboricity. We use this notion to extend a general result by Borodin and Ivanova. Not only this theorem implies results about planar graphs without 4-cycles adjacent to 3-cycle by Borodin and Ivanova, it also implies other results including a result by Kim and Yu [S.-J. Kim and X. Yu, Planar graphs without 4-cycles adjacent to triangles are DP-4-colorable, Graphs Combin. 35 (2019) 707-718] that every planar graph without 4-cycles adjacent to 3-cycles is DP-4-colorable.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "Accurate and efficient model predictive control (MPC) is essential for Internet of energy (IoE) to enable active real-time control, decentralized demand-supply balance, and dynamic energy management. The MPC consists of short-term electric load forecasting, whose accuracy is affected by the load characteristics, such as overdispersion, autocorrelation, and seasonal patterns. The forecasting efficiency depends on the computational time that is required to produce accurate results and is affected by the IoE data volume. Although several fundamental short-term forecasting models have been proposed, more accurate and efficient models are needed for IoE. Therefore, we propose a novel forecasting temporal negative binomial linear model (NBLM) that handles overdispersion and captures nonlinearity of electric load. We also classify the load into low, moderate, and high intraday seasons to increase the forecast accuracy by modeling the autocorrelation in each season, separately. The temporal NBLM was evaluated using real-world data from Jericho city, and its results were compared to other forecasting models. The temporal NBLM is found more accurate than the other models as the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is reduced by 29% compared to the ARMA model. In addition, the proposed model is more efficient as its running time is reduced by 63% in the training phase and by 87% in the forecast phase compared to the Holt-Winter model. This increase in accuracy and efficiency makes the proposed model applicable for load forecasting in IoE contexts where data volume is large and load is highly fluctuated, is overdispersed, is autocorrelated, and follows seasonal patterns.",

But, in many applications, these assumptions may be questionable because the true distributions of heterogeneity parameters are usually unknown. To this end, this paper relaxes these assumptions imposed on heterogeneity parameters to develop a nonparametric approach to purchase model and lifetime model, in which unknown distributions of heterogeneity parameters are approximated by a truncated Dirichlet process prior. A nonparametric empirical Bayesian method is developed to obtain Bayesian estimations of unknown parameters in the proposed nonparametric models. The blocked Gibbs sampler is presented to draw observations required for Bayesian inference from the corresponding posterior distributions of the components of parameters. Extensive simulation studies and a CDNOW data set are presented to illustrate the newly developed methodologies.",

Simulation studies show that the QML estimator has relatively lower bias and RMSE, compared with other prevalent low-frequency measures, and the results are more significant under overnight conditions.",

In recent years, researchers are trying to use the social characteristics of the network to propose new data forwarding metrics, so as to design more efficient routing algorithms. However, most of the proposed algorithms only consider local context information, which leads to the performance of the routing is not optimized enough. In this paper, we introduce two key metrics, namely, social relationship and social activity. The metrics will be used to search the best data forwarding nodes to improve the probability of data delivery. We propose a prediction-based social-aware opportunistic routing (PSOR). In the proposed method, node's social profiles are used to search relay candidates set, and the discrete-time semi-Markov prediction model is used to find the probability distribution of node transition between communities. Many simulation experiments based on real traces show that the proposed PSOR algorithm is more efficient to maximize the packet delivery probability than other state-of-the-art algorithms.",

In these models the response variable can be Gaussian or Non-Gaussian, so these models belong to the generalized linear mixed models, where the genetic correlation structure of data is considered through random effects with the normal distribution. But in many applications, it is unclear whether or not the normal assumption holds. Wrong Gaussian assumptions cause bias in the component variance estimates and affect the accuracy of results. In this paper, we have proposed a closed skew normal distribution for the genetic random effects which is more flexible and includes the normal distribution. The Bayesian inference approach and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms are developed for the parameter estimations. The performance of the proposed models is illustrated by a simulation study and an example. The accuracy of the closed skew normal model is favorably compared with the normal model in the simulation and the real example.",

In this regard, based on some different sorts of prior distributions for the unknown parameters, the appropriate designs are calculated. In the sequel, we define the random intercept model for the Cox regression model assuming the random intercept distributed normally. It is observed that the likelihood function of the observations cannot be acquired in a closed form. Thus, we obtain the quasi-information matrix based on the quasi-likelihood function. We then, use this matrix to obtain the A and D-optimal designs. It is seen that the Fisher information matrix depends on the unknown parameters as a result the locally optimal designs will be inefficient when the true guess about the parameters is failed. To overcome this problem, we propose the Bayesian strategy to obtain more robust optimal designs. Some numerical techniques such as Monte Carlo integration and numerical optimization methods are implemented to calculate the designs. Further, the generalized equivalence theorem is adapted to confirm the optimality of the proposed designs. All of the numerical results are done with R software. The results of this article will help to remove the weakness of the locally optimal designs that have been addressed in Schmidt and Schwabe when the parameters are misspecfied.",

There are several variations of pattern mining, such as frequent itemset mining, sequence mining, and high utility itemset mining. High utility itemset mining is an emerging data science task, aims to extract knowledge based on a domain objective. The utility of a pattern shows its effectiveness or benefit that can be calculated based on user priority and domain-specific understanding. The sequential pattern mining (SPM) issue is much examined and expanded in various directions. Sequential pattern mining enumerates sequential patterns in a sequence data collection. Researchers have paid more attention in recent years to frequent pattern mining over uncertain transaction dataset. In recent years, mining itemsets in big data have received extensive attention based on the Apache Hadoop and Spark framework. This paper seeks to give a broad overview of the distinct approaches to pattern mining in the Big Data domain. Initially, we investigate the problem involved with pattern mining approaches and associated techniques such as Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, parallel and distributed processing. Then we examine major developments in parallel, distributed, and scalable pattern mining, analyze them in the big data perspective and identify difficulties in designing the algorithms. In particular, we study four varieties of itemsets mining, i.e., parallel frequent itemsets mining, high utility itemset mining, sequential patterns mining and frequent itemset mining in uncertain data. This paper concludes with a discussion of open issues and opportunity. It also provides direction for further enhancement of existing approaches.",

The participants were 51 7th graders, and an eye-tracking system was used to record their visual behaviors and log data while they were using the simulation. As for data analysis, we first checked each participant's log data to examine whether they completed the requirement of the guidance, and then checked the correctness of her/his answer to the inquiry task. The participants were thus divided into two groups (correct vs. wrong), and the patterns of their visual behaviors were examined by a set of eye-movement indices, normalized heat maps and lag sequential analyses. The results indicate that both spatial distributions and temporal sequences of the participants' visual attention were associated with their performances on the inquiry task. Regarding the spatial distribution, the correct group tended to allocate more visual attention to the regions presenting the target phenomenon than the wrong group. Concerning the temporal sequence, the correct group tended to make more visual transitions among the content of the guidance, the relevant control panels and the target phenomena than the wrong group.",

However, enhancing precision, decreasing detection error, and detecting camouflaged items are still regarded as difficult problems. In this work, we concentrated on these problems and presented a model based on Faster-RCNN that utilizes saliency detection, proposal generation and bounding box regression, for better detection along with loss functions. The suggested method is referred to as the saliency driven Faster RCNN model for object detection and recognition using computer vision approach (SGFr-RCNN). The performance of the suggested strategy is assessed using the data sets (PASCAL VOC 2007, PASCAL VOC 2012 & CAMO_UOW) and contrasted with current methods in terms of mean average precision.

In this paper, two methods are discussed for deriving a bivariate discrete probability distribution from a continuous one by retaining some specific features of the original stochastic model, namely (1) the joint density function, or (2) the joint survival function. Examples of applications are presented, which involve two types of bivariate exponential distributions, in order to illustrate how the discretization procedures work and show whether and to which extent they alter the dependence structure of the original model. We also prove that some bivariate discrete distributions that were recently proposed in the literature can be actually regarded as discrete counterparts of well-known continuous models. A numerical study is presented in order to illustrate how the procedures are practically implemented and to present inferential aspects. Two real datasets, considering correlated discrete recurrence times (the former) and counts (the latter) are eventually fitted using two discrete analogues of a bivariate exponential distribution.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "In this study, we investigate a decentralized assembly system in which the suppliers are unreliable and have uncertain production capacities. We focus on the case in which a manufacturer deals with two suppliers that provide complementary products. We assume that the suppliers have the opportunity to improve their reliabilities through investments. The manufacturer determines her order quantities and the suppliers decide on their investment amounts in their capacities. The timing of the decisions has a substantial effect on the optimal behaviors of the players. We investigate the problem under four different settings based on the sequence of events: (1) simultaneous ordering and investment in which decisions are made concurrently, (2) ordering after observation of capacities in which the manufacturer orders after observing the suppliers\u2019 capacities, (3) ordering before realization of capacities in which the manufacturer orders after the suppliers\u2019 investment decisions, and (4) ordering before investments in which the suppliers invest after the manufacturer\u2019s ordering decision. We demonstrate the existence of a Pareto optimal equilibrium in the first two scenarios. In addition, we show that in the fourth scenario, there exists a unique Nash equilibrium in the suppliers\u2019 game. Based on the realized capacities of the suppliers, it may be beneficial for them to share their production information with the manufacturer. In addition, we indicate that using a sequential decision strategy can enhance the performances of the supply chain and the members. When the suppliers are the leaders, they implement investment inflation strategies to stimulate the manufacturer to place larger orders. When the manufacturer is the leader, she uses an order inflation strategy to increase the investment of the suppliers. Our numerical analysis revealed that in different situations, the players may prefer ordering before realization of capacities scenario or ordering before investments. Finally, we extended our results to a multiple-suppliers case in which the suppliers are identical.",

In this paper, we elaborate on the framework of Nikolaidis and Dimitriadis, based mainly on Statistical Process Control techniques and tools, which enables a deeper analysis and broader exploitation of student evaluation data. More specifically, we thoroughly examine and evaluate through simulation, several popular types of control charts (CCs), identifying the most suitable among them, using as comparison criteria various statistical properties of CCs. The ultimate goal of our research is to provide decision makers in HE institutions with an easy-to-use reliable tool for not only monitoring the teaching process, but also identifying the effective and ineffective faculty members' teaching performance to promote the quality of their Institution.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "In data mining, outlier detection is applied in different domains. It has very large applications such as energy consumption analysis, forecasting hurricanes in meteorological data, fraud and intrusion detection, event detection and system monitoring in sensor networks, etc. Most of existing outlier detection techniques depend on the properties of a particular type of data and can not deal with a large volume of data well, which mean that there is a necessity for improved methodologies and techniques to be applied to a large amount of data with different types in other application areas. In this paper, a parallel outlier detection technique is developed to detect the outliers in the sequential data. Although there are many types of outliers, this paper concentrates on the contextual anomalies. The proposed technique uses a graph approach to detect the outliers. It is very flexible, fast, and no labeled data is needed comparing to many previous approaches. The experimental results show the detected contextual outliers in the sequential data, as well as the efficient scaling up to handle the massive data by increasing the number of processors. The results prove that the parallelism of the proposed technique is very valuable. (C) 2019 The Authors. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of clustering ensemble which aims to combine multiple clusterings into a probably better solution in terms of robustness, novelty and stability. The proposed Iterative Combining Clusterings Method (ICCM) processes iteratively the entire dataset, where each iteration is based on two steps framework. In the first step, different clustering algorithms process the common data set individually and, in the next step, a set of sub-clusters is extracted through a voting process among the data objects. To overcome the ambiguity due to voting, only objects with majority voting are assigned to their correspondent sub-clusters. The remaining objects are then collected and re-clustered in the next iterations. At the end of the iterative process, a clustering algorithm is used to group the obtained sub cluster centres and extract the final clusters of the dataset. Two gene expression datasets and three real-life datasets have been used to evaluate the proposed approach using external and internal criteria. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, where an improvement up to 16.89% for iris dataset, and up to 14.98% for wine dataset in DB index has been achieved. The external validity metrics confirm the usefulness of the proposed approach by achieving the highest average NMI (%) score of 81.05%, across the datasets compared to different clustering ensemble methods.

Traditional methods to detect fraud require costly and lengthy investigations that involve complex financial and legal knowledge, as well as highly skilled analysts. Based on the motto \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d that should be adopted by any rational investor, we propose herein the use of a robust performance measure (named GUN*) to construct an Index for detection of anomalies (called IDeA). This index is based on the basic intuition that it is not possible to properly evaluate a fund as \u201cgood\u201d regardless the characteristics and risk aversion of investors. After defining the intuition behind such an index and its economic theoretical background, we illustrate our innovative operations research methodology for fraud detection and demonstrate its usefulness studying the emblematic case of the fraud by Madoff.",

The non response is the source of missing data and it is an unavoidable phenomenon in survey sampling. This problem becomes more severe in the case of repeated surveys because of its repetitious nature. The missing data due to random causes which we call as random non-response is an important issue which needs to be dealt with a more cautious approach. To address these thoughts, this study is an attempt to reduce the adverse impact of random non response in the estimation of population variance on the current occasion in two-occasion successive sampling. A composite class of estimators for estimation of population variance on the current occasion has been proposed and its properties are deeply examined. An empirical study is carried out to show the efficacious performances of the proposed class of estimators over an estimator defined for the complete response situation. Suitable recommendations are made to the survey practitioners for their real-life practical applications.",

It is important to explore how learner-learner, learner-teacher and learner-content interactions affect on learning outcomes while using the social sites such as Facebook, Twitter, WeChat, Blogs, etc. Although some prior research highlight that there is a demand for interaction in online courses, specific design tactics and empirical evaluation of the effects of interaction on learning outcomes in blog-based courses are lacking. Thus, a blog learning platform named \"Learner's Digest Blog\" (LDB) was developed to facilitate the three types of interactions and enhance learning outcomes. A total of 26 learners participated in the blog-based interactive learning environment. The study addressed two research questions, and regression analysis was used to analyze the data. The findings indicated a significant influence between learner-learner interaction, learner-teacher interaction and learner-content interaction on subjective learning outcome. In contrast, there was no significant influence of learner-teacher interaction on objective learning outcomes, but learner-learner and learner-content did significantly affect objective learning outcomes. A significant relationship was also found between students' subjective and objective learning outcomes.",

Our purpose of this paper is to articulate the application of variation theory in the form of a number of concrete design principles that offer prescriptive and practical guidelines for improving the designs of educational software programs. To achieve this, we analyzed a wide range of educational software programs produced over the years in our previous projects for learning Chinese characters. From this analysis, we identified four design principles, namely, (i) not aiming to test but to bring about learning, (ii) focusing on a specific object of learning, (iii) allowing learners to explore variation to be learned, and (iv) keeping all other aspects invariant. These design principles are specialized for designing how learners interact with educational software programs, which is the major practical contribution of this paper.",

Symbolic Artificial Intelligence with its hard coding rules is incapable of solving these complex problems resulting in the introduction of Deep Learning (DL) models such as Recurrent Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). However, CNNs require lots of training data and are incapable of recognizing pose and deformation of objects leading to the introduction of Capsule Networks. Capsule Networks are the new sensation in Deep Learning. They have lived to this expectation as their performance in relation to the above problems has been better than Convolutional Neural Networks. Even with this promise in performance, lack of architectural knowledge and inner workings of Capsules serves as a hindrance for researchers to take full advantage of this breakthrough. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the state of the art architectures, tools and methodologies in existing implementations of capsule networks. We highlight the successes, failures and opportunities for further research to serve as a motivation to researchers and industry players to exploit the full potential of this new field. The main contribution of this survey article is that it explains and summarizes significant current state of the art Capsule Network architectures and implementations. (c) 2019 The Authors.

Considering the fact that continuous data have more information rather than discrete data, survival time after cardiac surgery is considered as a continuous quality characteristic in this paper. Accelerated failure time regression model is used to adjust the risk of patients' conditions and surgeon groups on the survival times. After that, a risk-adjusted exponentially weighted moving average control chart is proposed to monitor the standardized residuals of accelerated failure time regression. Since the false alarm rate of each patient change dramatically, dynamic probability control limits have been extended to address the issue. The proposed method is evaluated in Phase II in terms of average run length criterion. The results indicate that the proposed method has acceptable performance in identifying the out-of-control state in the process. Furthermore, considering the effect of surgeon groups in the accelerated failure time regression model leads to improvement in the performance of the proposed method.",

First, the appropriate neighboring samples are found in the state of the sample point and the next state to form the neighborhood matrix. Then, the manifold hidden inside the data is extracted, ie, the evolution trend of the process parameters between different brands. At the same time, a monitoring model is built with the training data based on the support vector data description (SVDD). If an outlier is detected, it will be projected onto the manifold to obtain the adjustment values. Thus, the outlier can return to the normal state. The Swiss roll and actual production data of interstitial-free (IF) steels are employed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the new method considers the continuity of process parameters of different product grades in the production process and uses data to extract the potential manifold, ie, using the evolution trend of process parameters among different product grades to achieve the optimization of the process parameter. The proposed method provides a new process parameter optimization method for the actual production process.",

If the response is binary there is a mixture of Bernoulli distributions, which has practical applications for the classification of texts and images, biochemistry, genetics, robotics, computer science or pattern recognition. A finite mixture of probability distributions includes a set of parameters such as the proportion of the mixture and the parameters of each distribution. This simple case allows us to make some explicit computations of the estimators as well as working on the EM algorithm doing some comparisons. Some of these parameters may depend on one or more covariates through some specific model. Mixtures of exponential family distributions, except in very particular cases, are no longer within the exponential family and this means, among other things, that the expectation for computing the Information Matrix must, in most cases, be approximated. One of the main contributions of this article is its handling of this. Linear and logistic models are considered either for the proportion of one of the two populations (clusters), or for the parameters of the Bernoulli distributions. For each of these cases the analytic expression of the information matrix is calculated and optimal designs determined.",

By using recent results obtained in the problem of temporal dependence structure of univariate stochastic processes, where the auto-codifference was used, we extend its idea and propose a cross-codifference measure for a general bidimensional vector autoregressive time series of order 1 (bidimensional VAR(1)). Next, we derive analytical results for VAR(1) model with Gaussian and stable sub-Gaussian innovations, that are characterized by finite and infinite variance, respectively. We emphasize that obtained expressions perfectly agree with the empirical counterparts. Moreover, we show that for the considered time series the cross-codifference simplifies to the well-established cross-covariance in the case when the innovations of time series are given by Gaussian white noise. The last part of the work is devoted to the statistical estimation of VAR(1) time series parameters based on the empirical cross-codifference. Again, we demonstrate via Monte Carlo simulations that the proposed methodology works correctly.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "In the field of shape analysis, landmarks are defined as a low-dimensional, representative set of important features of an object's shape that can be used to identify regions of interest along its outline. An important problem is to infer the number and arrangement of landmarks, given a set of shapes drawn from a population. One proposed approach defines a posterior distribution over landmark locations by associating each landmark configuration with a linear reconstruction of the shape. In practice, sampling from the resulting posterior density is challenging using standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods because multiple configurations of landmarks can describe a complex shape similarly well, manifesting in a multi-modal posterior with well-separated modes. Standard MCMC methods traverse multi-modal posteriors poorly and, even when multiple modes are identified, the relative amount of time spent in each one can be misleading. We apply new advances in the parallel tempering literature to the problem of landmark detection, providing guidance on implementation generalized to other applications within shape analysis. Proposal adaptation is used during burn-in to ensure efficient traversal of the parameter space while maintaining computational efficiency. We demonstrate this algorithm on simulated data and common shapes obtained from computer vision scenes.",

In a previous paper, we have shown that the conditional selection criteria perform worse than their marginal counterparts. It is known that for some ?vague? priors, their impact on the estimated model parameters can be non-negligible, e.g., for the priors of the covariance matrix of the random effects in a longitudinal LMM. We evaluate here the impact of vague priors for the covariance matrix of the random effects on selecting the correct LMM using classical Bayesian selection criteria. We consider marginal and conditional criteria. For the random intercept case, we assign different vague priors to the variance parameters. With two or more random effects, we considered five different specifications of inverse-Wishart (IW) prior, five different separation priors and a joint prior. The results show again the better performance of the marginal over the conditional criteria and the superiority of joint and separation priors over IW in all settings. We also illustrate the performance of the selection criteria on a practical dataset.",

For data transmission between devices, different levels of quality of service (QoS) are used in MQTT. In this paper, we provide a formal model for MQTT protocol under the Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP) semantic framework, where QoS levels in MQTT are modeled as designs in UTP. Refinement and equivalence relations between QoS levels can be established naturally via implication between predicates. Moreover, Prototype Verification System (PVS) is used to encode the UTP design models and some important properties as well as the refinement relation between QoS levels is proved with the PVS proof assistant.",

These has an influence on online marketing and obtaining real knowledge about products and services. However, some of the online reviews can be unreal. They may have been written to promote low-quality products/services or sabotage a product/service reputation to mislead potential customers. Such misleading reviews are known as spam reviews and require crucial attention. Prior spam detection research focused on English reviews, with less attention to other languages. The detection of spam reviews in Arabic online sources is a relatively new topic despite the relatively huge amount of data generated. Therefore, this paper contributes to such topic by presenting four different Arabic spam reviews detection methods, while putting more focus towards the construction and evaluation of an ensemble approach. The proposed ensemble method is based on integrating a rule-based classifier with machine learning techniques, while utilizing content-based features that depend on N-gram features and Negation handling. The four proposed methods are evaluated on two datasets of different sizes. The results indicate the efficiency of the ensemble approach where it achieves a classification accuracy of 95.25% and 99.98% for the two experimented datasets and outperforming existing related work by far of 25%.

We consider a wireless sensor network consisting of randomly deployed sensor nodes and directional border nodes deployed using a random line deployment model. When an event is detected, sensor nodes form one or more event-based clusters. Cluster heads are in charge with aggregating data from the clusters and sending them to the border nodes, which will adjust the orientation angle such that to monitor intruders crossing the barrier. We use simulations using WSNet and MatLab to analyze the performance of our algorithm and to compare it with other non-clustering gap-mending algorithms.",

A detailed analysis of algorithm examples shows that the heuristic algorithm can greatly reduce the number of processing nodes compared to the backtracking algorithm without information; meanwhile, the algorithm's time complexity is related to the number of loops in the directed graph. If a directed graph G(V, E) only contains loops that contain the starting point, then the Hamiltonian problem of G can be determined in polynomial time. The algorithm is implemented using C++ and Python programming, and all of the test graphs are generated by the random graph algorithm. The experiments show that the heuristic algorithm can reduce the number of extended nodes by at least 10% in directed random graphs with no or only a few loops. This heuristic algorithm can save time in applications that perform tasks while extending nodes because it reduce the number of extended nodes.",

The chart performance is assessed using optimized design parameters that provide the smallest ARL for a range of shifts.

Results show that the ZIP-AEWMA chart has superior performance over the competing charts for a wide range of process shifts, especially when the probability of excessive zeros in data is high.

It is important to measure the system reliability of a stochastic flow network from the perspective of operations management. In the real world, the system reliability of a stochastic flow network can vary over time. Hence, a critical issue emerges\u2014characterizing the time attribute in a stochastic flow network. To solve this issue, this study bridges (classical) reliability theory and the reliability of a stochastic flow network. This study utilizes Weibull distribution as a possible reliability function to quantify the time attribute in a stochastic flow network. For more general cases, the proposed model and algorithm can apply any reliability function and is not limited to Weibull distribution. First, the reliability of every single component is modeled by Weibull distribution to consider the time attribute, where such components comprise a multi-state element. Once the time constraint is given, the capacity probability distribution of elements can be derived. Second, an algorithm to generate minimal component vectors for given demand is provided. Finally, the system reliability can be calculated in terms of the derived capacity probability distribution and the generated minimal component vectors. In addition, a big data architecture is proposed for the model to collect and estimate the parameters of the reliability function. For future research in which very large volumes of data may be collected, the proposed model and architecture can be applied to time-dependent monitoring.",

Perception of Time did not directly associate with attitude and intention, but it was a significant predictor for perceived usefulness. Gender did not moderate the perception of time in explaining university students? MOOCs acceptance as expected. This study yields insights into the understanding of time? role in the acceptance of MOOCs, which contributes to the development of technology acceptance theory in educational context and adds value to MOOC teaching and learning practice.",

Despite the popularity of MOOCs, they have received less attention from faculty members around the globe compared to other less-traditional and digital education models. MOOCs can be challenging for teachers to use. As such, understanding how to facilitate teachers? adoption of MOOCs is very important to better promote their use. The aim of this research paper is to investigate the drivers of teachers? acceptance and use of MOOCs from the perspective of the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2). An online survey was used to collect responses from university faculty in Taiwan. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was utilized for data analysis. The findings reveal that performance expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and price value facilitated teachers? behavioral intention to adopt MOOCs. Furthermore, facilitating conditions and behavioral intention determined teachers? adoption of MOOCs. However, effort expectancy and hedonic motivation failed to drive teachers? adoption of MOOCs. Based on the findings, several important theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

A common tool in analyzing this cop number of a graph is a cop moving along a shortest path in a graph, thus preventing the robber to step onto this path. We generalize this approach by introducing a shadow of the robber, the maximal set of vertices from which the cop parries the protected subgraph. In this context, the robber becomes an intruder and the cop becomes the guard. We show that the shadow can be computed in polynomial time, implying polynomial time algorithms for computing both a successful guard as well as a successful intruder, whichever exists. Furthermore, we show that shadow function generalizes the concept of graph retractions. In some cases, this implies a polynomially computable certification of the negative answer to the NP-complete problem of existence of a retraction to a given subgraph.",

We further quantified sentiments in three values (1, \u22121, and 0), either in 1 for (positive/yes/true) or \u22121 for (negative/no/False) and 0 for (neutral or absence of sentiment) and stored them in a table (named as ternary sentiment table). Then, we have done an entropic calculation on this ternary sentiment table to find the quantity of information stored in its associated rows and columns. This proposed quantification further helps to identify the most important attribute of the table. It helps to decide weight for the different attributes and applying calculated weights to corresponding attributes to obtain the quantified ordered decision-making values.",

The vehicular nodes in NLOS conditions possess the possibility of introducing channel congestion and broadcast storm into the network either intentionally or unintentionally during the event of emergency message dissemination in the vehicular network. Thus, the NLOS vehicular nodes of the network need to be detected through direct interaction and neighbourhood collaboration such that the rate of emergency message dissemination is sustained to the maximum degree. In this paper, a Rank Criteria Improved Confidence-based Centroid Scheme (RCICCS) is proposed for potential localization of NLOS nodes. This proposed RCICCS scheme uses an integrated cost, computed using the primitive cost and penalty cost in order to increase the effectiveness in localizing NLOS nodes. Thus effective location of NLOS nodes is determined based on rank criterion-based neighbor confidence measure that are iteratively enhanced during the process of perturbation using the method of gradients. The experimental analysis of the proposed RCICCS scheme confirmed a remarkable enhancement rate of emergency message delivery and neighbourhood awareness under NLOS conditions.",

The high cost of fault in time-critical systems necessitates methods to explicitly consider the influence of correlation on reliability. This paper constructs a network-structured model, namely time-constrained multi-state network (TCMSN), to investigate the capacity of a computer network. In the TCMSN, the physical lines comprising the edges of the computer network experience correlated faults. Our approach quantifies the probability that d units of data can be sent from source to sink in no more than T units of time. This probability that the computer network delivers a specified level of data before the deadline is referred to as the system reliability. Experimental results indicate that the negative influence of correlation on reliability could be significant, especially when the data amount is close to network bandwidth and the time constraint is tight. The modeling approach will subsequently promote design and optimization studies to mitigate the vulnerability of networks to correlated faults.",

Hence in this paper, we focus on some inferential results of the skew-normal distribution.

Also, the most informative part of a sample is determined via simulation. The maximum likelihood estimators of skewness parameter are derived based on both complete sample and the most informative part of the sample and their efficiencies are compared.

However, the partial breaking of SHA2 and SHA3 families and the breaking of MD5 and SHA-160 algorithms raise concerns on the use of bitwise operators at the block level. The proposed design tries to address this structural flaw through a polynomial function. A polynomial function of degree 128 demands arduous effort to be decoded in the opposing direction. The application of a polynomial on the blocks produces an unpredictable random response. It is a fact that the new design exhibits the merits of the polynomial function on subsets to achieve the avalanche response to a significant level. The output from experiments with more than 24 Million hash searches proves the proposed system is a provably secure hash function. The experiments on avalanche response and confusion and diffusion analysis prove it is an apt choice for security-centric cryptographic applications.",

A review of peer-reviewed journal articles published in English over the past 10 years uncovered common pedagogical themes that were categorized into a pre-game, game, and post-game taxonomy. The findings indicated that teachers implemented a variety of instructional activities at the pre-game, game, and post-game stages. Pre-game activities consisted mostly of lectures and gameplay trainings. At the game stage, teachers engaged in content scaffolding, performed classroom management activities, and provided technical assistance to students during gameplay. At the post-game stage, teachers organized debriefing sessions to ensure that gameplay translated into learning outcomes for students. Recommendations are made for the integration of games into teaching and learning in order to maximize student engagement and learning outcomes.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "With rapid development of cloud computing services, traffic in data centers (DCs) increases dramatically. Top-of-rack Ethernet switches dominate network cost and energy consumptions in DCs. Optical switching technologies have been introduced into DC networks to increase switching capacity and to reduce energy consumption. However, how to design high-performance optical intrarack networks is still a great challenge. This paper presents a software-defined passive optical intrarack network (SD-POIRN) based on optical coupler fabrics. The data plane of SD-POIRN is a broadcast-and-select optical network combining wavelength division multiplexing and time division multiplexing technologies. The control plane of SD-POIRN has a centralized rack controller for scheduling intrarack data transmissions. This paper proposes a software-defined media access control (SD-MAC) protocol for SD-POIRN. The SD-MAC utilizes dynamic transmission and receiving server grouping methods and max-min fair share bandwidth allocation algorithms to dynamically allocate bandwidth among servers in an efficient and fair manner. Network performance evaluation results show that, when the offered load is high, the proposed SD-MAC protocol effectively increases network throughput and reduces average packet delay compared with previous works.",

In this design, the interval between two successive sampling intervals, the sample size and the number of adjustment points alongside, the parameters of the monitoring scheme are determined such that not only the implementation cost is minimized, but also the profile exhibits desired statistical performances. To this aim, three objective functions are considered in the multi-objective optimization model of the problem. The Lorenzen-Vance cost function is used to model the implementation cost as the first objective function to be minimized. The second objective function maximizes the in-control average run length of the monitoring scheme (ARL(0)), while the third objective function minimizes the out-of-control average run length (ARL(1)). In addition, a lower bound is defined in a constraint for ARL(0) and an upper bound is determined in another constraint for ARL(1). The complex multi-objective optimization problem is solved by an NSGA-II algorithm, whose parameters are tuned using response surface methodology (RSM). A numerical illustration is solved, for which the Pareto optimal solutions are ranked by a multi-criteria decision-making method called Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Finally, sensitivity analyses are conducted on the parameters of the cost function, based on which the time required to sample and create a profile is the most important factor.",

For the synchronous product net of the process and a log trace, we can assign different costs to a synchronous move, and a move in the log or model. By computing a path through this (synchronous) product net, whilst minimizing the total cost, we create a so-called optimal alignment \u2014 which is considered to be the primary target result for conformance checking. Traditional alignment-based approaches (1) have performance problems for larger logs and models, and (2) do not provide reliable diagnostics for non-conforming behaviour (e.g. bottleneck analysis is based on events that did not happen). This is the reason to explore an alternative approach that maximizes the use of observed events. We also introduce the notion of milestone activities, i.e. unskippable activities, and show how the different approaches relate to each other. We propose a data structure, that can be computed from the process model, which can be used for (1) computing alignments of many log traces that maximize synchronous moves, and (2) as a means for analysing non-conforming behaviour. In our experiments we show the differences of various alignment cost functions. We also show how the performance of constructing alignments with our data structure relates to that of the state-of-the-art techniques.",

It introduces a performance prediction architecture that includes two modules. One module is to handle the big data via MapReduce framework (incorporates the concept of principle component analysis), whereas the second module is an intelligent module that predicts the performance of the students using data processing stages. For this, this paper introduces a new hybrid classifier, which hybridizes the deep belief network and support vector machine. The output from the proposed classifier gives an accurate prediction of student performance. The performance of the proposed prediction model is compared over other conventional methods in terms of accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, negative predictive value, F1-score Matthews correlation coefficient, false positive rate, false negative rate and false discovery rate, and proven the superiority of proposed prediction model.",

The distributed mobility management (DMM) is emerging as a promising approach for 5G, which provides decentralized handover and traffic management at the edge of the network. However, in order to meet the disparate mobility needs, the DMM process requires flexible design considerations. This paper presents a novel mobile node (MN) centered, software-defined networking (SDN)-based flexible mobility management architecture, named adaptive multimode mobility management (A3M), which can adaptively operate in multiple modes. The proposed A3M architecture incorporates a novel handover mode selection phase among the traditional handover phases during which a suitable mode of handover operation is evaluated. This makes the A3M handover process adaptable to the varying mobility requirements of the MN and enables it to provide differentiated handover management for MNs with different mobility profiles. The performance analysis of A3M shows that it offers optimal handover performance in terms of primary handover performance metrics such as session disruption delay, packet losses, and signaling costs, compared to the popular network-based DMM approaches.",

For this, 60 undergraduate students of electronics and electrical engineering were introduced to the ARLE system, in two different case studies. The first case validates the efficacy of using AR for learning the concept of stability in linear control systems through a questionnaire based survey where students reported the ARLE as an effective learning system for theoretical topics. Second case study provides comparative analysis for usability of two design variants of the ARLE in terms of manipulability and comprehensibility. Finally, the design implications for developed ARLE are discussed, which may be helpful for other researchers in creating learning environments for different courses of engineering education.",

First approach detects maliciousness level of nodes using two modules, namely, certification module and monitoring module. Certification module defends the network from the jammers. Monitoring module discovers the sensor nodes that are jammed by a jammer. Second approach uses fuzzy logic for optimizing the jamming metrics to determine the occurrence of jamming accurately. The proposed system achieves 99.58% detection ratio to determine node's maliciousness level.",

However, there is significant difference in reliability prediction based on different process. This paper proposes a unified distribution model combined with a stochastic process model in multiple accelerated stress degradation test. To solve the problem of heterogeneous population of pseudo failure data, the Birnbaum\u2013Saunders model is considered as a unified distribution model for different Gaussian family process. To give an example, a detailed proof for substituting the Birnbaum\u2013Saunders model for the first-passage time of Wiener process is provided. Then, the influence of the parameters of the Birnbaum\u2013Saunders model was analyzed, which provided a basis for the Birnbaum\u2013Saunders model to be selected as a unified model. To verify presented model, a case study of Smart Meter ADT is conducted. And the obtained results of this work is compared with former work of Smart Meter ADT modeling, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed modeling method to heterogeneous population.",

As technology advances at a rapid pace, some issues yet remain unresolved. One of the issues is phishing, which dates back to the 1980s. Phishing is an art used by cybercriminals from the 1980s until to date targeting online users to harvest financial, confidential, and other sensitive information. The art and the methodologies used by cybercriminals have not evolved much from the AOL (American online) heydays. However, the counter mechanisms to defeat phishing have undergone considerable changes over the past two decades. Although sophisticated antiphishing systems are in place, statistics shows that phishing is a major threat. Our practical research proves that one of the state-of-the-art antiphishing systems can be bypassed using simple techniques. The research further demonstrates why today's antiphishing mechanisms fail and the need for a novel mechanism that will identify the authenticity of the website. In this manuscript, an antiphishing algorithm, PhishSec (PH-Sec), is introduced. PhishSec will not consider the URL of the website as the primary factor to determine the authenticity, rather take a reverse approach where the URL of the website is derived by analyzing the content of the visited website to establish its authenticity. To accomplish this, the HTML DOM (document object model) of a given web page on load is considered. This manuscript quotes the research results of the analysis of a state-of-the-art antiphishing system along with the introduced algorithm to counter-attack phishing. The introduced system detects phishing attacks with 99.21% of accuracy.",

However, it will cause out-of-order delivery of packets, which will not only severely debilitate the performances of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) but also will make many single-path-based applications work improperly. In this paper, we propose to utilize passive delay measurements between end-hosts, to detect multipath routing with two different hypothesis testing approaches, ie, t-Test and variance test. The motivation is that the obtained distributions of passive delays between end-to-end communication flows can be very similar to each other when they are routed by the identical end-to-end path, whereas distinct differences are observed among the ones of different end-to-end paths. Simulations based on NS2 validate the efficiency of both t-Test and variance test and demonstrate the robustness of t-Test against asynchronous measurements between different flows.",

Therefore, nearest neighbor (1:1), caliper, stratification, mahalanobis metric, full and combining propensity score and mahalanobis metric matching, which have been widely used as PSM methods, were compared in terms of the correct classification rates conducting a detailed Monte Carlo simulation study. In addition, standardized and percent reduction bias of covariates were evaluated for each of the PSM methods. It is suggested that stratification and full matching methods should be considered to study with high correct classification rate whereas caliper matching method should be prefered due to the low bias to make statistical inferences.",

Based on Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the increase in efficiency of the SPCD by use of the PGDRM and SCD can be significant, especially when the variation of responses between patients is large.

Congested network causes reduced network response time, queuing delay, and more packet loss. To address the issue of congestion, we have proposed transmission rate control methods. To avoid the congestion, we have adjusted the transmission rate at current node based on its traffic loading information. Multiclassification is done to control the congestion using an effective data science technique, namely support vector machine (SVM). In order to get less miss classification error, differential evolution (DE) and grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithms are used to tune the SVM parameters. The comparative analysis has shown that the proposed approaches DE-SVM and GWO-SVM are more proficient than other classification techniques. Moreover, DE-SVM and GWO-SVM have outperformed the benchmark technique genetic algorithm-SVM by producing 3% and 1% less classification errors, respectively. For fault detection in wireless sensor networks, we have induced four types of faults in the sensor readings and detected the faults using the proposed enhanced random forest. We have made a comparative analysis with state of the art data science techniques based on two metrics, ie, detection accuracy and true positive rate. Enhanced random forest has detected the faults with 81% percent accuracy and outperformed the other classifiers in fault detection.",

The results of this research revealed that there are innumerable differences among university learners in terms of trajectory movement, and most of the students care only about a few common learning places like classrooms or laboratories. However, there are other trajectory movements that directly or indirectly influence sustainable academic performance. The research findings suggest that students and academicians are aware of not only the frequent trajectory movements, such as in the classroom, laboratory, and library but also the other trajectory movements inside and outside the campus which may severely affect sustainable academic performance. This study focuses on discovering the relationship between university students' trajectory movement tendencies and sustainable performance in higher educational institutions to fulfill sustainable development goals and how trajectory movements affect students' educational performance in various ways to ensure a better academic outcome for sustainable development.",

After the owner of some confidential data outsources the data to cloud storage services and shares it with others, the data owner lost the control to the data to a large extent. To achieve data sharing while keeping data confidentiality, attribute-based encryption (ABE) can be employed by cloud storage services. However, ABE can only guarantee that outsourced data on the cloud is decrypted by attribute-satisfying users but cannot restrict data from being accessed by dishonest users whose attributes also satisfy the access-control policy. It is impossible for the data owner to control the shared data after it has been decrypted by dishonest users, especially when a set of attribute-satisfying dishonest users may collude. To address this concern, we propose a traceable data sharing scheme called TraceChain. In TraceChain, data is encrypted over a new CP-ABE scheme called E-CP-ABE. Furthermore, the system parameters for generating the private key in E-CP-ABE are uploaded to the private blockchain and transactions are performed on the chain. The data owner can obtain the identity of users by monitoring system parameters simultaneously and control data sharing on the blockchain. To prove the security of our scheme, the security analysis is given in this paper. Meanwhile, experimental results also show that our system is viable and efficient.",

In order to solve this problem, this paper creatively proposes a health condition diagnosis method of distribution transformer based on large data. This method innovatively proposes that the dissolved gas analysis value of distribution transformer is the conditional attribute, and the fault type is the decision attribute, and the fault decision table is established. The continuous attribute data in the decision table are discretized by using the optimization behavior of large data sets. Subsequently, the discretized decision table is simplified by using the big data theory, and the decision table of fault diagnosis rules is established, which greatly simplifies the difficulty of attribute simplification of decision table and makes diagnosis more convenient. Finally, an example shows that the proposed method can effectively discretize and reduce samples. Compared with traditional methods, it improves the accuracy of fault diagnosis.",

Therefore, a centralized, automated scrutiny system among multiple app stores is inevitable to prevent publishing pirated or cloned version of these Android applications. In this paper, we proposed an Android clone detection system for Internet of things (IoT) (Droid-IoT) devices. First, the proposed system receives an original Android application package (APK) file along with possible candidate cloned APKs over the cloud network. The system uses an apkExtractor tool to extract Dalvik Executable (DEX) files for each subject program. The Jdex decompiler is used to extract Java source files from DEXs. Then, the bag-of-word model is used to extract tokenized features from source files. Further, the weighting filters are used to zoom the importance of each token. Moreover, Synthetic Minority Oversampling is applied to retrieve balanced features for better training of data. Finally, TensorFlow with Keras deep learning model is designed to predict clones in Android applications. The experimental results have shown that Droid-IoT can successfully detect cloned apps with an accuracy of up to 96%. The primary purpose of this system is to prevent the publishing of pirated apps among different app stores under different pirated names.",

In data center network (DCN), the traffic has been rising constantly in the past few years. Hence, greater traffic of network needs several services such as Domain Name Service (DNS) to manage. It is not possible for one server to manage entire requests coming from client because of huge amount of traffic. To resolve this issue, load balancing is used. The major purpose of load balancing is to forward incoming client requests and distribute the traffic across various servers using customized algorithm which is deployed in the load balancer. Traditional load balancers are very costly and inflexible hardware. A substitute of this hardware is to use software-defined network load balancers. The software-defined networking (SDN) load balancers offer the facility to programmers to design and construct their own strategy of load balancing, which makes the software-defined network load balancer flexible and programmable. This research proposes a novel algorithm that performs load balancing through calculating in advance the capacity of each and every switch across the path to which the packets are routed.",

The forgered image appears original, as the objective region in spite of being forged, has attained the fundamental qualities of the similar image itself. The capability of the copy-move forgery detection (CMFD) technique is lacked due to some post-processing functions, like JPEG compression scaling, or rotation, etc. Therefore, this paper intends to develop a CMFD using Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), best-fin-first algorithm (BBF) and RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) directed by grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm. Initially, the keypoints are selected using SIFT principle, and BBF algorithm identifies the matched keypoints using keypoint threshold. Further, SIFT feature descriptor is determined, and the final extracted paired keypoints are given to RANSAC algorithm to remove all the mismatched keypoints. In this CMFD model, the parameters such as parameters keypoint threshold, maximum distance of inliers in RANSAC and distance threshold in SIFT features are optimized using GWO. The foremost purpose of this research work is maximizing the number of paired keypoints. Hence the proposed model is termed as GWO-based parameter optimization for CMFD (GWPO-CMD). The proposed model is compared over several other meta-heuristic-based keypoint threshold selections and proves its efficiency through diverse analysis.",

The placement of relay nodes in a wireless body area network (WBAN) plays an important role in design of energy efficient and reliable WBAN. This problem is a joint problem of data routing and placement of relay nodes and formulated as a linear integer programming model. The main objective of the problem is to minimize the cost of relay nodes, energy consumption and distributing the loads uniformly on the relay nodes. Considering the hardness of the problem, we propose an adaptive cuckoo search based algorithm which uses an efficient fitness function and an adaptive step size proportional to the fitness function for placement of relay nodes. The set of relay nodes obtained by our proposed adaptive cuckoo search algorithm compared with cuckoo search as well as other state of the art algorithms via simulation results. The simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm not only consumes less energy than its counterparts but also distributes the load evenly on the relay nodes. We consider two different postures of the body with 13 biosensors placed in fixed positions and 50\u2013100 candidate sites for placement of relay nodes. Furthermore, we also consider 80 biosensors randomly deployed in a rectangular area with 50\u2013300 candidate sites to study the scalability of our algorithm.",

Actually, these techniques may be limited in measuring the child's progress in a systematic way considering different fields. To overcome these limitations, we developed Autistic Innovative Assistant (AIA) which is an Android smartphone app that is dedicated to teach Arabic autistic children the necessary linguistic and mathematical basics in addition to improving their social skills through creating an interactive learning environment. The proposed app covers five main categories with an interactive quiz, included in each, as an assessment tool. The lessons included in each category are viewed as a series of colorful pictures with a written sentence and an audio message to describe the meaning of each, thereby attracting the child's attention and making learning a fun activity. Each child's supervisor can access his/her quizzes' records, measure the child's progress in different categories, and use the related recommendation reports to adjust the app usage pattern. AIA was tested by a group of autistic children for a one-month test period in a real life environment represented in \"Jordan Specialized Center for Autism\" and the results and feedback were very promising.",

We model a single-period Stackelberg game in which a manufacturer sells new products to a retailer and collects used products with exogenous retail price and collection price via three alternative reverse channels: (a) the manufacturer collects directly from customers, (b) the retailer collects for the manufacturer, and (c) a third party is awarded a collection subcontract from the manufacturer. We carry out a comprehensive investigation under push-pull configurations to observe how reverse channel structures with different gaming sequences of CLSC members influence the worst-case performance when the demand distribution is over the set of increasing generalized failure rate distributions. From our PoA analysis, we find that the pull system does not always outperform the push system, especially when the retailer is the leader, in contrast to the results for forward supply chains. While the PoA of the push system is dramatically sensitive to the quality condition of used products, the pull system has a constant efficiency loss that is independent of the quality condition. Instead, the PoA of the pull system solely changes with the gaming sequence of the manufacturer. We also find that manufacturer's direct collection is a better reverse channel choice compared to retailer's collection. Additional managerial insights are summarized for discussion.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "The importance of inventory management for perishable items has been steadily attracting attention. Because of the characteristics of items whose values drop precipitously or cannot be sold after a particular time, items should be disposed of by a markdown sale. Accordingly, the company makes the following decisions at the end of the selling season: (a) selection on which products to be discounted, (b) pricing of the product, and (c) timing of the sale. Extant literature on the inventory problem has mainly focused on investigating decisions on selecting products for discount and the amount of the discount. That is, the decision on the start time of the markdown sale was not extensively studied. This study focuses on the optimal combination of a start time of the markdown sale and an order quantity based on a newsvendor model. Under certain conditions in a decentralized system, the start time of a markdown sale, where the retailer obtains the highest profit, is the least profitable for the manufacturer. Therefore, we propose a revenue-sharing contract to avoid irrational ordering behavior by a retailer against a manufacturer. Centralization through the revenue-sharing contract improves the profits of the retailer and manufacturer compared to those earned in the decentralized system.",

Within a time span of eight years from 2011 to 2018, approximately 2600, 230, 150, and 110 scientific articles were published from the USA, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, respectively around this area of research. To comprehensively survey all the sub-fields and interests within this research area, the present paper proposes a novel density-based method for finding topic descriptors from academic articles. By employing a robust to noise fuzzy clustering algorithm, the terms are clustered, and by utilizing a modified Parzen window, k topic descriptors from each cluster are extracted. Besides, an optimization problem has been designed to detect the similarity between word pairs. By conducting the experiments, the research priorities for four countries within this time span have been found. Moreover, the closeness of the research in developing countries to the developed country have been measured. The experimental results show that for four years, the research topics in Turkey were close to the research topics in the USA on average, and the research topics in Saudi Arabia were close to the USA topics during the past two years. Additionally, the experimental comparison of the proposed method with two clustering baselines indicates the superiority of the proposed method in terms of precision, recall, and accuracy.",

The toughness of G, denoted tau (G), is the maximum value of t such that G is t-tough (taking tau (K-n) = infinity for all n >= 1). It is known that a Hamilton-connected graph G has toughness tau (G) > 1, but that the reverse statement does not hold in general. In this paper, we investigate all possible forbidden subgraphs H such that every H-free graph G with tau (G) > 1 is Hamilton-connected. We find that the results are completely analogous to the Hamiltonian case: every graph H such that any 1-tough H-free graph is Hamiltonian also ensures that every H-free graph with toughness larger than one is Hamilton-connected. And similarly, there is no other forbidden subgraph having this property, except possibly for the graph K-1 ? P-4 itself. We leave this as an open case.",

This irrefutable fact has been a major reason for making digital forensic (DF) a pressing and timely topic to investigate. Thanks to the file system which is a rich source of digital evidence that may prove or deny a digital crime. Yet, although there are many tools that can be used to extract potentially conclusive evidence from the file system, there is still a need to develop effective techniques for evaluating the extracted evidence and link it directly to a digital crime. Machine learning can be posed as a possible solution looming in the horizon. This article proposes an Enhanced Multiclass Support Vector Machine (EMSVM) model that aims to improve the classification performance. The EMSVM suggests a new technique in selecting the most effective set of parameters when building a SVM model. In addition, since the DF is considered a multiclass classification problem duo to the fact that a file system might be accecced by more than one application, the EMSVM enhances the class assignment mechanism by supporting multi-class classification. The article then investigates the applicability of the proposed model in analysing incriminating digital evidence by inspecting the historical activities of file systems to realize if a malicious program manipulated them. The results obtained from the proposed model were promising when compared to several machine-learning algorithms.",

Under fixed alternatives, authors have established that nuisance parameter estimates are inconsistent when sample size re-estimation (SSR) follows blinded randomization. These results have helped to inhibit the use of SSR. In this paper, we argue for local alternatives to be used instead of fixed alternatives. We treat unavailable treatment assignments in blinded experiments as missing data and rely on single imputation from marginal distributions to fill in for missing data. With local alternatives, it is sufficient to proceed only with the first step of the EM algorithm mimicking imputation under the null hypothesis. Then, we show that blinded and unblinded estimates of the nuisance parameter are consistent, and re-estimated sample sizes converge to their locally asymptotically optimal values. This theoretical finding is confirmed through Monte-Carlo simulation studies. Practical utility is illustrated through a multiple logistic regression example. We conclude that, for hypothesis testing with a predetermined minimally clinically relevant local effect size, both blinded and unblinded SSR procedures lead to similar sample sizes and power.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "The notion of a 12-representable graph was introduced by Jones, Kitaev, Pyatkin and Remmel in [Representing graphs via pattern avoiding words, Electron. J. Combin. 22 (2015) #P2.53]. This notion generalizes the notions of the much studied permutation graphs and co-interval graphs. It is known that any 12-representable graph is a comparability graph, and also that a tree is 12-representable if and only if it is a double caterpillar. Moreover, Jones et al. initiated the study of 12- representability of induced subgraphs of a grid graph, and asked whether it is possible to characterize such graphs. This question of Jones et al. is meant to be about induced subgraphs of a grid graph that consist of squares, which we call square grid graphs. However, an induced subgraph in a grid graph does not have to contain entire squares, and we call such graphs line grid graphs. In this paper we answer the question of Jones et al. by providing a complete characterization of 12-representable square grid graphs in terms of forbidden induced subgraphs. Moreover, we conjecture such a characterization for the line grid graphs and give a number of results towards solving this challenging conjecture. Our results are a major step in the direction of characterization of all 12-representable graphs since beyond our characterization, we also discuss relations between graph labelings and 12-representability, one of the key open questions in the area.",

In this paper, we propose an efficient construction of bivariate copulas on MEWMA and Hotelling's T-2 control charts. Observations are classified with Kendall's tau values as weak, moderate, and strong positive dependence by using a Monte Carlo simulation to measure the average run length as a performance metric. The numerical results obtained from the simulation show that the performances of the MEWMA and Hotelling's T-2 control charts were similar for small shifts (delta <= 0.01) but the MEWMA control chart showed higher performance for moderate to large shifts.",

Then MFA and RMDS are two approaches for representing the individuals. We study the analogies and differences between both methodologies to guide users interested in performing multidimensional representations of mixed-type data. Though in general MFA and RMDS provide similar results, we prove that RMDS takes into account the association between the different sets of variables, providing, in some cases, better and more coherent representations. We also propose a parametric RMDS which includes MFA as a particular case. Article in memory of John C. Gower (1930-2019).",

The study analyzed the existing research on author nationalities, application domains, research methods, participants, learning strategies, and research issues. Based on the analysis data, starting from 2015, there have been a large number of flipped classroom studies in science education. The studies were mainly from the United States; the application domains were mostly chemistry, physics, biology, and natural science and ecology. Over half of the studies adopted quantitative methods, and participants were mainly college students. In the before-class stage, the flipped classroom studies in science education mainly adopted instructional videos as the learning materials and used online learning systems as the medium for materials and online discussion. In the in-class stage, the major learning strategy was problem-based learning, while over half of the studies did not employ educational technology. In the after-class stage, most studies administered examinations to explore the learning outcomes. Accordingly, Potential research issues are proposed as a reference for future studies.",

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is an advance implementation for Internet of Things (IoT). BLE beacons-based indoor positioning systems provide an easy and energy-efficient, low deployment cost solution for wide variety of applications including smart phones. This paper presents an in-depth experimental study of BLE RSSI in a dense indoor environment. Due to noise, fluctuations in RSSI occur, which produces distance estimation error, which ultimately affect position estimation accuracy. The main objective of this paper is to know the variations in RSSI and develop a radio propagation model in order to minimize the distance estimation and position estimation error. Based on our real-time experimental analysis using BLE modules, there is an average 1.32-m position estimation error in the presence of 10-dBm variation in RSSI. Moreover, we also observed that environmental specific radio propagation constants greatly affect distance and position estimation accuracy in BLE modules.",

Data analysis was performed using the structural equation modeling (SEM) with data obtained from a survey of 261 company employees. The empirical results reveal that perceived organizational formalization significant affected cognitive processes theorized by TPB, behavioral habits, and deterrent certainty.

While there are numerous applications of virtualization for off-the-shelf hardware such as security, sandboxing, testing tools, etc. However, there are few open-source virtualization solutions available for embedded systems. For real-time virtualization, good runtime performance is a deterministic factor for its practical use in the embedded domain. In this paper, the internal architecture of HTTM (an open-source type-2 hypervisor for MIPS64 architecture) was thoroughly analyzed. ISA virtualization unit and execution cycle control were two primary units that were profiled and explored for optimization. Dynamic Binary Translation (DBT) unit was modified to generate highly efficient code. While the reduction in switching between the translated code and management layer improved the overall execution cycle. The implementation of these strategies resulted in a 72\u201391% improvement in bandwidth benchmarks. Similarly, latency benchmarks show a 2\u201392% improvement from its vanilla version. Collectively producing an overall 1\u20135 times the improvement in execution time. The performance of optimized HTTM is also compared with Quick Emulator (QEMU). HTTM performs 44\u201380% better than QEMU in bandwidth benchmarks while QEMU performs better in latency operations.",

In various ultrahigh dimensional data, variables are naturally grouped, giving us a good rationale to develop a screening method using joint effect of multiple variables. In this article, we propose a group screening procedure via the F-test statistic. The proposed method is a direct extension of the original sure independence screening procedure, when the group information is known, for example, from prior knowledge. Under certain regularity conditions, we prove that the proposed group screening procedure possesses the sure screening property that selects all effective groups with a probability approaching one at an exponential rate. We use simulations to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method and show its application in a genome-wide association study. We conclude that the grouping method is very useful in the analysis of ultrahigh dimensional data, as the optimal F-test can detect true signals with desired properties.",

It is an efficient optimization algorithm and since demonstrates excellent performance in solving continuous problems, but cannot resolve directly binary optimization problems. Many optimization problems have been modelled as binary problems since their decision variables varied in binary space such as feature selection in data classification. The main goal of feature selection is to find a small size subset of feature from a sizeable original set of features that optimize the classification accuracy. In this paper, a new binary variant of the grasshopper optimization algorithm is proposed and used for the feature subset selection problem. This proposed new binary grasshopper optimization algorithm is tested and compared to five well-known swarm-based algorithms used in feature selection problem. All these algorithms are implemented and experimented assessed on twenty data sets with various sizes. The results demonstrated that the proposed approach could outperform the other tested methods.",

However, generality goes to the detriment of the possibility to model details and peculiarities of a particular application domain. As acknowledged by the literature, known approaches predominantly focus on one aspect between control flow and data, thus neglecting the interplay between the two. Moreover, process instances are not considered or considered in isolation, neglecting, among other aspects, synchronization points among them. As a consequence, the model is an approximation of the real process, limiting its reliability and usefulness in particular domains. This observation emerged clearly in the context of a research project in the construction domain, where preliminary attempts to model inter-company processes show the lack of an appropriate language.",

As the benefits of cloud is attractive, the number of users adopting to the cloud also increases, so the workflow management becomes tedious and more challenging in the cloud. The decision to provide with an enhanced work flow management requires proper scheduling recollecting value of the information. So the paper proposes with an efficient method of managing the work flow considering the value of the information by categorizing between the much value and non-value information's and framing the algorithm that functions as scheduler using the parallel implementation in natural process of genetic algorithm (GA) with secured frame work for the information's of high value.

The model expresses the efficiency of the maintenance by a reduction in the virtual age of the system and a change in the parameters of the failure intensity. Depending on the maintenance decisions, the parameters of the failure intensity may shift and the virtual age of the system is reduced to zero or lower value. Both of Kijima type 1 and Kijima type 2 models were considered in modeling the virtual age of the system. The maximum likelihood estimation is considered to determine the estimation of the model parameters. The obtained results were applied on sets of simulated data, taking into account the left truncated and the right censored cases. In order to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed model, two real data sets were applied, it has been shown that the model can provide a better fit than its sub-models. In some cases, we have seen that the change in the parameters can also change the shape of the hazard function. The confidence intervals for the estimated parameters were obtained using the parametric bootstrap and the bias-corrected accelerated bootstrap methods.",

These methods have a good performance when all the observations follow the assumed model. However, if a small proportion of atypical observations is present in the sample, these estimators become unreliable. A robust estimation method for these models is proposed and applied to two real data sets.

However, many existing security solutions specifically in the field of authentication are not suitable for IoTs due to the computation involved. Alternatively, the lightweight existing solutions are vulnerable to various attack(s). In this paper, a lightweight and compromise-resilient authentication (LCA) scheme for IoT is proposed. The proposed LCA scheme is lightweight because it uses lightweight hash and XOR operations. The security analysis manifests that the proposed scheme is compromise resilient against numerous security attacks. The proposed LCA scheme is compared with existing authentication schemes based on execution time, security, and computation cost. The outcomes show that the proposed LCA scheme is more secure and robust as compared to the existing authentication schemes proposed for IoTs.",

Firstly, we collect millions of tweets of six typical events. Following, we construct a sentiment lexicon suitable for online behavior analysis, and we also construct a lexicon for tweet preprocessing and emotional score calculation. Secondly, to include the semantics during sentence similarity calculation, we employ the tweets collected to train the word2vec model and employ the sum of the word vectors in specific sentences to form the sentence vector.

The network contains a group of sensor nodes, which are capable of sensing, computing, and transmitting. Energy efficiency is one of the most important challenging problems in WSN. Sensor nodes have inadequate energy and installed in remote areas. Hence, it is difficult to restore the batteries in WSN. Therefore, to maximize the network lifetime, appropriate clustering techniques and cluster head (CH) selection methods should be implemented. The main idea behind the clustering technique is that it clusters the sensor nodes and reduces the composed data simultaneously and then, it broadcasts the data. In this process, CH selection is an essential part. Therefore, this survey paper provides an overview of the clustering techniques for reducing energy consumption by reviewing several CH selection techniques in WSN that provide high energy efficiency. Several techniques have been employed for CH selection based on partitional clustering, optimization, low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy, hierarchical, distributed, and other classification methods. Finally, an analysis is done based on the implementation tools, metrics employed, accuracy, and achievements of the considered CH selection techniques.",

At the time of the information transmission process, node contains high energy, and battery of node may be recharged continuously, which leads to reduction of the entire information transmission system performance. This paper introduces the multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) method with energy-efficient protocol for reducing the energy consumption in the network. Initially, the network coverage is determined by applying the shadow fading sensing model, and the clusters are formed with the help of the particle dual clustering process. After the cluster is formed, the information has been transmitted with the help of the energy-aware peering routing protocol (EPR), which reduces the network traffic and also improves the energy efficiency with efficient manner. Then, the efficiency of the system is analyzed with the help of experimental results in terms of coverage fraction, accuracy of the cluster, and energy consumption.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "An optimal software release strategy is a well-investigated issue in software reliability literature. Comprehensive testing is expected before releasing the software into the market to enhance the reliability and security of the software device. In recent years, few analysts have recommended the scheme for software projects that support releasing the software early in the market and continue the testing process for an added period in the field environment even after the software is distributed. These studies are based on one common assumption that the efficiency of the software engineers in detecting the faults occurs at a consistent rate throughout the testing phase. However, bug-identification rate may experience discontinuity at the software release time. In software engineering, the time-point at which fault detection rate changes is termed as change-point. Consequently, an alternative software release policy is proposed in the present paper, which offers a generalized framework for fault detection phenomenon using the unified approach. An extensive analysis of software time-to-market and testing duration based on cost-efficiency and reliability measures is discussed by considering the change in tester\u2019s fault detection rate. A multi-criteria decision making technique known as multi-attribute utility theory is applied to optimize the software release policy under field-testing (FT) and no field-testing (NFT) frameworks. The relevance of the optimization problem is illustrated using a numerical example, comprising both the exponential and S-shaped bug-detection process.",

From the perspective of matching between flow and path, the traffic scheduling is properly arranged. We first propose and model the path-flow matching problem, considering the preference ordering, then formulate the problem as a multiobjective optimization problem with the target to ensure the stability and satisfaction from the matching scheme, and design a preference-based path-flow ordering method Extended PIAS, and finally propose a lightweight scheduling algorithm LinkGame based on multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. Compared with the previous scheduling methods (ECMP, Hedera, and Fincher), experiment results demonstrate that LinkGame can simultaneously consider the stability and satisfaction of the matching results, with improved bandwidth utilization and flow completion time.",

The performance of these new tests was evaluated under normal and non-normal distributions through Monte Carlo simulations.

The type I error rats and power were computed in all Monte Carlo simulations by using the R software. The parametric bootstrap test based on the T-2 test statistic had equivalent performance of the T-2 original test.

The work focus on Rayleigh and Nakagami fading channel with comparable nonfading AWGN channel in cognitive radio. An ensemble model to detect the presence of primary user with high confidence is proposed in this work. The approach is based on training machine learning models with energy vectors in presence and absence of primary users. The trained model is then used to predict the primary user based on the energy vector.",

Six hundred and sixty-eight college students were invited to complete a self-reported questionnaire measuring TAM constructs and three hypothesized variables drawn from MOOC characteristics. The results from path analysis showed that all path coefficients were statistically significant. Perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment significantly affected students' behavioral intention to use MOOCs, while both perceived usefulness and behavioral intention yielded a significant influence on perceived effective use of MOOCs. Usability and perceived quality had a strong indirect impact on behavioral intention and perceived effective use through the mediators of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment.

Controlling the order release to limit work in process at a stable level and protect throughput from variation is crucial to achieving robustness of manufacturing system performance. To deal with the influences of bottleneck severity and variable resource on system performance, a refined order release method is presented, which releases order periodically based on the corrected aggregate load and continuously based on the bottleneck buffer load. The operational quality of this method with the classical order release method under non-repetitive dynamic manufacturing system is compared by modeling and simulation. The results show that the refined order release method is more robust for general flow shop with higher protective capacity and resource variability.",

Under certain environmental conditions and wildfire situations, burning embers can be lofted across a natural or man-made barrier devoid of fuel, such as a river or road, resulting in new ignitions downwind of the main advancing fire front. This phenomenon, referred to as a \"spot fire\" or \"spotting,\" can put a considerable strain on firefighting operations and pose a grave risk to wildland-urban interface communities. In this article, we formulate the process of spot fire development, and derive the distribution of the time to the first spot fire occurring beyond a barrier to fire spread. A simulator is developed in the framework of generating burning embers from an active wildfire that may result in a spot fire. With the generated data, we demonstrate how to estimate the rate of developing spot fires and identify significant covariates based on data in two practical formats.",

However, the energy is a major challenge in the WSN environment as the battery-operated sensor nodes in the network consumes huge amount of energy during transmission. This work addresses the energy issue and provides an energy efficient multi-hop routing in WSN named Taylor based Cat Salp Swarm Algorithm (Taylor C-SSA) by modifying C-SSA with Taylor series. This method undergoes two stages for attaining multi-hop routing, which includes selection of cluster head (CH), and transmission of data. Initially, the energy-efficient cluster heads are selected using the Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol for effective data transmission, the sensor nodes sends data over the CH, which transmits the data to the base station through the selected optimal hop. The optimal hop selection is done using the proposed Taylor C-SSA. Moreover, the security aware multi-hop routing is performed by introducing trust model that involves indirect trust, integrity factor, direct trust, and data forwarding rate. The proposed Taylor C-SSA algorithm shows best performance in terms of energy, number of alive nodes, delay, and throughput values of 0.129, 42, 0.291, and 0.1, respectively.",

An intrusion detection system is involved extensive mass of data; such data is naturally characterized with repetitions and noise which leads to the reduction in the stability and the accuracy of the intrusion detection system. Hence, the issue of reducing features dimensions for achieving a smaller subset of features which can precisely express the results and status of network observations has attracted a lot of researchers\u2019 attention. In the proposed method, by using gradually feature removal method, 16 critical features were selected for representing various network visits. By combining ant colony algorithm and ensemble of decision trees, we proposed an efficient and stable classifier for judging a network visit to be normal or not. Despite the selection of 16 features, high accuracy, i.e. 99.92%, and the average value of Matthews correlation coefficient 0.91 are obtained.",

Recently, the number of IoT applications has increased dramatically, including smart homes, vehicular ad hoc network (VANETs), health care, smart cities, and wearables. As reported in IHS Markit (see ), the number of connected devices is projected to jump from approximately 27 billion in 2017 to 125 billion in 2030, an average annual increment of 12%. Security is a critical issue in today's IoT field because of the nature of the architecture, the types of devices, different methods of communication (mainly wireless), and the volume of data being transmitted over the network. Security becomes even more important as the number of devices connected to the IoT increases. To overcome the challenges of securing IoT devices, we propose a new deep learning-based intrusion detection system (DL-IDS) to detect security threats in IoT environments. There are many IDSs in the literature, but they lack optimal features learning and data set management, which are significant issues that affect the accuracy of attack detection. Our proposed module combines the spider monkey optimization (SMO) algorithm and the stacked-deep polynomial network (SDPN) to achieve optimal detection recognition; SMO selects the optimal features in the data sets and SDPN classifies the data as normal or anomalies. The types of anomalies detected by DL-IDS include denial of service (DoS), user-to-root (U2R) attack, probe attack, and remote-to-local (R2L) attack. Extensive analysis indicates that the proposed DL-IDS achieves better performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score.",

One collects previous cases, called \"scenarios\", for the set-up in which optimization is being performed, and makes a decision that is optimal for the cases that have been collected. For convex optimization, a solid theory has been developed that provides guarantees of performance, and constraint satisfaction, of the scenario solution. In this paper, we open a new direction of investigation: the risk that a performance is not achieved, or that constraints are violated, is studied jointly with the complexity (as precisely defined in the paper) of the solution. It is shown that the joint probability distribution of risk and complexity is concentrated in such a way that the complexity carries fundamental information to tightly judge the risk. This result is obtained without requiring extra knowledge on the underlying optimization problem than that carried by the scenarios; in particular, no extra knowledge on the distribution by which scenarios are generated is assumed, so that the result is broadly applicable. This deep-seated result unveils a fundamental and general structure of data-driven optimization and suggests practical approaches for risk assessment.",

A set D of vertices in G is a semitotal dominating set of G if D is a dominating set of G and every vertex in D is within distance 2 from another vertex of D. Given a graph G and a positive integer k, the semitotal domination problem is to decide whether G has a semitotal dominating set of cardinality at most k. The semitotal domination problem is known to be NP-complete for chordal graphs and bipartite graphs as shown in [M.A. Henning and A. Pandey, Algorithmic aspects of semitotal domination in graphs, Theoret. Comput. Sci. 766 (2019) 46-57]. In this paper, we present a linear time algorithm to compute a minimum semitotal dominating set in block graphs. On the other hand, we show that the semitotal domination problem remains NP-complete for undirected path graphs.",

Cellverse is being designed by the Collaborative Learning Environments in Virtual Reality (CLEVR) team, an interdisciplinary team consisting of game designers, educational researchers, and graduate and undergraduate students. Using a design-based research approach, we have enlisted the help of both subject matter experts and user testers to iteratively design and improve Cellverse. The objective of this paper is to share how user and expert feedback can inform and enhance the development of learning games. We describe how we gather and synthesize information to review and revise our game from in-game observations, semi-structured interviews, and video data. We discuss the input of subject matter experts, present feedback from our user testers, and describe how input from both parties influenced the design of Cellverse. Our results suggest that including feedback from both experts and users has provided information that can clarify gameplay, instruction, subject portrayal, narrative, and in-game goals.",

We propose several robust alternatives for the covariance matrix, which are constructed by combining robust correlation estimators with robust variation measures. Through extensive numerical studies we demonstrate the robust performance of our proposed approaches compared to the standard methods based on the sample covariance matrix. Further, we apply our proposals to a real data application, aimed at studying the optimal portfolio allocations in Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite index.

In this paper, we, therefore, report on our latest empirical study that recently explored both the perceptions and experiences of practitioners about SP 1.3 implementation. During our research, we visited three firms and carried out three in-depth interviews. We developed a SP 1.3 model using the different experiences and opinions of practitioners regarding SP 1.3 implementation. The four essential stages of this model are plan, design, review, and update/rework. Practitioners will receive advice in this model about implementing SP 1.3 effectively.",

In this paper, we propose a natural (time) domain technique for the diagnosis of PD. The proposed technique eliminates the need for transformation of the signal to other domains by extracting the feature of electroencephalography signals in the time domain. We hypothesize that two inter-channel similarity features, correlation coefficients and linear predictive coefficients, are able to detect the PD signals automatically using support vector machines classifier with third degree polynomial kernel. A progressive feature addition analysis is employed using selected features obtained based on the feature ranking and principal component analysis techniques. The proposed approach is able to achieve a maximum accuracy of 99.1 +/- 0.1%. The presented computer-aided diagnosis system can act as an assistive tool to confirm the finding of PD by the clinicians.",

In this paper, we propose an Energy Efficient Distributed Lightweight Authentication and Encryption (EEDLAE) technique for IoT security. In our proposed technique, the receiver generates the token for each sender. The token expiration time is determined based on the trust value of each sender, and sleep period of the receiver radio is determined based on its remaining energy. For encryption, Counter with Cipher Block Chaining-Message Authentication Code (CCM) is applied. Experimental results show that EEDLAE technique can hold out against affected packets, higher resilience against node capture, increased throughput, and residual energy, compared with the existing technique.",

The proposed biometric cryptosystem has two phases: enrolment and verification. Each of them comprises three main stages: feature extraction, reliable components extraction, and fuzzy commitment scheme. Gait features are extracted from gait images using local ternary pattern (LTP), and then, the average of one complete gait cycle using the gait energy image (GEl) concept is calculated. The average images are joined using a 2D joint histogram, which is reduced using principal component analysis (PCA) to produce the final feature vector. To enhance the robustness of the system, only highly robust and reliable bits from the feature vector are extracted. Finally, the fuzzy commitment scheme is used to secure feature templates. Bose\u2013Chaudhuri\u2013Hocquenghem codes (BCH) are used for key encoding in the enrolment phase and for decoding in the verification phase. The proposed system is tested using the CMU MoBo and CASIA A databases. The experimental results show that the best error rate for the CMU MoBo database is obtained when using a fast walk for enrolment and verification, where we obtain 0% for the false acceptance rate (FAR) and 0% for the false rejection rate (FRR) for a key length equal to 50 bits. The best error rate for CASIA A dataset is obtained when using the 45-degree direction to the image plane view for enrolment and verification, where we obtain 0% for the false acceptance rate (FAR) and 0% for the false rejection rate (FRR) for a key length equal to 45 bits.",

Biological constraints were also considered. Exact methods, based on the nonlinear model and on a linearization of that model were proposed to generate Pareto optimal solutions for the problem of sustainable cultivation, along with a metaheuristic approach for the problem based on a genetic algorithm and on constructive heuristics. The methods were tested using semi-randomly generated instances to simulate real situations. According to the experimental results, the exact methodologies performed favorably for small and medium size instances. The heuristic method was able to potentially determine Pareto optimal solutions of good quality, in a reduced computational time, even for high dimension instances. Therefore, the mathematical models and the methods proposed may support a powerful methodology for this complex decision-making problem.",

This class corresponds to problems that can be reformulated as deterministic convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems with indicator variables and continuous scenario variables, but the size of the reformulation is large and quickly becomes impractical as the number of scenarios grows. The Branch-and-Cut algorithm is based on an implicit Benders decomposition scheme, where we generate cutting planes as outer approximation cuts from the projection of the feasible region on suitable subspaces. The size of the master problem in our scheme is much smaller than the deterministic reformulation of the chance-constrained problem. We apply the Branch-and-Cut algorithm to the mid-term hydro scheduling problem, for which we propose a chance-constrained formulation. A computational study using data from ten hydroplants in Greece shows that the proposed methodology solves instances faster than applying a general-purpose solver for convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems to the deterministic reformulation, and scales much better with the number of scenarios.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "The increasing adoption of modelling methods contributes to a better understanding of the flow of processes, from the internal behaviour of a single organisation to a wider perspective where several organisations exchange messages. In this regard, BPMN collaborations provide a suitable modelling abstraction. Even if this is a widely accepted notation, only a limited effort has been expended in formalising its semantics, especially for what it concerns the interplay among control features, data handling and exchange of messages in scenarios requiring multiple instances of interacting participants. In this paper, we face the problem of providing a formal semantics for BPMN collaborations including elements dealing with multiple instances, i.e., multi-instance pools and sequential/parallel multi-instance tasks. For an accurate account of these features, it is necessary to consider the data perspective of collaboration models, thus supporting data objects, data collections and data stores, and different execution modalities of tasks concerning atomicity and concurrency. Beyond defining a novel formalisation, we also provide a BPMN collaboration animator tool, named MIDA, faithfully implementing the formal semantics. MIDA can also support designers in debugging multi-instance collaboration models.",

Within a time span of eight years from 2011 to 2018, approximately 2600, 230, 150, and 110 scientific articles were published from the USA, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, respectively around this area of research. To comprehensively survey all the sub-fields and interests within this research area, the present paper proposes a novel density-based method for finding topic descriptors from academic articles. By employing a robust to noise fuzzy clustering algorithm, the terms are clustered, and by utilizing a modified Parzen window, k topic descriptors from each cluster are extracted. Besides, an optimization problem has been designed to detect the similarity between word pairs. By conducting the experiments, the research priorities for four countries within this time span have been found. Moreover, the closeness of the research in developing countries to the developed country have been measured. The experimental results show that for four years, the research topics in Turkey were close to the research topics in the USA on average, and the research topics in Saudi Arabia were close to the USA topics during the past two years. Additionally, the experimental comparison of the proposed method with two clustering baselines indicates the superiority of the proposed method in terms of precision, recall, and accuracy.",

Yet, although there are many tools that can be used to extract potentially conclusive evidence from the file system, there is still a need to develop effective techniques for evaluating the extracted evidence and link it directly to a digital crime. Machine learning can be posed as a possible solution looming in the horizon. This article proposes an Enhanced Multiclass Support Vector Machine (EMSVM) model that aims to improve the classification performance. The EMSVM suggests a new technique in selecting the most effective set of parameters when building a SVM model. In addition, since the DF is considered a multiclass classification problem duo to the fact that a file system might be accecced by more than one application, the EMSVM enhances the class assignment mechanism by supporting multi-class classification. The article then investigates the applicability of the proposed model in analysing incriminating digital evidence by inspecting the historical activities of file systems to realize if a malicious program manipulated them. The results obtained from the proposed model were promising when compared to several machine-learning algorithms.",

These results have helped to inhibit the use of SSR. In this paper, we argue for local alternatives to be used instead of fixed alternatives. We treat unavailable treatment assignments in blinded experiments as missing data and rely on single imputation from marginal distributions to fill in for missing data. With local alternatives, it is sufficient to proceed only with the first step of the EM algorithm mimicking imputation under the null hypothesis. Then, we show that blinded and unblinded estimates of the nuisance parameter are consistent, and re-estimated sample sizes converge to their locally asymptotically optimal values. This theoretical finding is confirmed through Monte-Carlo simulation studies. Practical utility is illustrated through a multiple logistic regression example. We conclude that, for hypothesis testing with a predetermined minimally clinically relevant local effect size, both blinded and unblinded SSR procedures lead to similar sample sizes and power.",

Combin. 22 (2015) #P2.53]. This notion generalizes the notions of the much studied permutation graphs and co-interval graphs. It is known that any 12-representable graph is a comparability graph, and also that a tree is 12-representable if and only if it is a double caterpillar. Moreover, Jones et al. initiated the study of 12- representability of induced subgraphs of a grid graph, and asked whether it is possible to characterize such graphs. This question of Jones et al. is meant to be about induced subgraphs of a grid graph that consist of squares, which we call square grid graphs. However, an induced subgraph in a grid graph does not have to contain entire squares, and we call such graphs line grid graphs. In this paper we answer the question of Jones et al. by providing a complete characterization of 12-representable square grid graphs in terms of forbidden induced subgraphs. Moreover, we conjecture such a characterization for the line grid graphs and give a number of results towards solving this challenging conjecture. Our results are a major step in the direction of characterization of all 12-representable graphs since beyond our characterization, we also discuss relations between graph labelings and 12-representability, one of the key open questions in the area.",

In this paper, we propose an efficient construction of bivariate copulas on MEWMA and Hotelling's T-2 control charts. Observations are classified with Kendall's tau values as weak, moderate, and strong positive dependence by using a Monte Carlo simulation to measure the average run length as a performance metric. The numerical results obtained from the simulation show that the performances of the MEWMA and Hotelling's T-2 control charts were similar for small shifts (delta <= 0.01) but the MEWMA control chart showed higher performance for moderate to large shifts.",

This paper presents an in-depth experimental study of BLE RSSI in a dense indoor environment. Due to noise, fluctuations in RSSI occur, which produces distance estimation error, which ultimately affect position estimation accuracy. The main objective of this paper is to know the variations in RSSI and develop a radio propagation model in order to minimize the distance estimation and position estimation error. Based on our real-time experimental analysis using BLE modules, there is an average 1.32-m position estimation error in the presence of 10-dBm variation in RSSI. Moreover, we also observed that environmental specific radio propagation constants greatly affect distance and position estimation accuracy in BLE modules.",

Data analysis was performed using the structural equation modeling (SEM) with data obtained from a survey of 261 company employees. The empirical results reveal that perceived organizational formalization significant affected cognitive processes theorized by TPB, behavioral habits, and deterrent certainty.

While there are numerous applications of virtualization for off-the-shelf hardware such as security, sandboxing, testing tools, etc. However, there are few open-source virtualization solutions available for embedded systems. For real-time virtualization, good runtime performance is a deterministic factor for its practical use in the embedded domain. In this paper, the internal architecture of HTTM (an open-source type-2 hypervisor for MIPS64 architecture) was thoroughly analyzed. ISA virtualization unit and execution cycle control were two primary units that were profiled and explored for optimization. Dynamic Binary Translation (DBT) unit was modified to generate highly efficient code. While the reduction in switching between the translated code and management layer improved the overall execution cycle. The implementation of these strategies resulted in a 72–91% improvement in bandwidth benchmarks. Similarly, latency benchmarks show a 2–92% improvement from its vanilla version. Collectively producing an overall 1–5 times the improvement in execution time. The performance of optimized HTTM is also compared with Quick Emulator (QEMU). HTTM performs 44–80% better than QEMU in bandwidth benchmarks while QEMU performs better in latency operations.",

In various ultrahigh dimensional data, variables are naturally grouped, giving us a good rationale to develop a screening method using joint effect of multiple variables. In this article, we propose a group screening procedure via the F-test statistic. The proposed method is a direct extension of the original sure independence screening procedure, when the group information is known, for example, from prior knowledge. Under certain regularity conditions, we prove that the proposed group screening procedure possesses the sure screening property that selects all effective groups with a probability approaching one at an exponential rate. We use simulations to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method and show its application in a genome-wide association study. We conclude that the grouping method is very useful in the analysis of ultrahigh dimensional data, as the optimal F-test can detect true signals with desired properties.",

However, generality goes to the detriment of the possibility to model details and peculiarities of a particular application domain.

Moreover, process instances are not considered or considered in isolation, neglecting, among other aspects, synchronization points among them. As a consequence, the model is an approximation of the real process, limiting its reliability and usefulness in particular domains. This observation emerged clearly in the context of a research project in the construction domain, where preliminary attempts to model inter-company processes show the lack of an appropriate language.",

In simpler terms it is a means of storing and accessing information over internet irrespective of place and time. The cloud proceeds with the process of storing, retrieving and allowing access, on demand as a paid service. As the benefits of cloud is attractive, the number of users adopting to the cloud also increases, so the workflow management becomes tedious and more challenging in the cloud. The decision to provide with an enhanced work flow management requires proper scheduling recollecting value of the information. So the paper proposes with an efficient method of managing the work flow considering the value of the information by categorizing between the much value and non-value information's and framing the algorithm that functions as scheduler using the parallel implementation in natural process of genetic algorithm (GA) with secured frame work for the information's of high value. The proposed work shows an overwhelmed performance than the conventional techniques in the time taken for the execution and its total cost. The performance of the scheduler is validated in the WORKFLOWSIM on the grounds of time of execution and total cost.",

Both of Kijima type 1 and Kijima type 2 models were considered in modeling the virtual age of the system. The maximum likelihood estimation is considered to determine the estimation of the model parameters. The obtained results were applied on sets of simulated data, taking into account the left truncated and the right censored cases. In order to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed model, two real data sets were applied, it has been shown that the model can provide a better fit than its sub-models. In some cases, we have seen that the change in the parameters can also change the shape of the hazard function. The confidence intervals for the estimated parameters were obtained using the parametric bootstrap and the bias-corrected accelerated bootstrap methods.",

However, many existing security solutions specifically in the field of authentication are not suitable for IoTs due to the computation involved. Alternatively, the lightweight existing solutions are vulnerable to various attack(s). In this paper, a lightweight and compromise-resilient authentication (LCA) scheme for IoT is proposed. The proposed LCA scheme is lightweight because it uses lightweight hash and XOR operations. The security analysis manifests that the proposed scheme is compromise resilient against numerous security attacks. The proposed LCA scheme is compared with existing authentication schemes based on execution time, security, and computation cost. The outcomes show that the proposed LCA scheme is more secure and robust as compared to the existing authentication schemes proposed for IoTs.",

After the cluster is formed, the information has been transmitted with the help of the energy-aware peering routing protocol (EPR), which reduces the network traffic and also improves the energy efficiency with efficient manner. Then, the efficiency of the system is analyzed with the help of experimental results in terms of coverage fraction, accuracy of the cluster, and energy consumption.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "An optimal software release strategy is a well-investigated issue in software reliability literature. Comprehensive testing is expected before releasing the software into the market to enhance the reliability and security of the software device. In recent years, few analysts have recommended the scheme for software projects that support releasing the software early in the market and continue the testing process for an added period in the field environment even after the software is distributed. These studies are based on one common assumption that the efficiency of the software engineers in detecting the faults occurs at a consistent rate throughout the testing phase. However, bug-identification rate may experience discontinuity at the software release time. In software engineering, the time-point at which fault detection rate changes is termed as change-point. Consequently, an alternative software release policy is proposed in the present paper, which offers a generalized framework for fault detection phenomenon using the unified approach. An extensive analysis of software time-to-market and testing duration based on cost-efficiency and reliability measures is discussed by considering the change in tester’s fault detection rate. A multi-criteria decision making technique known as multi-attribute utility theory is applied to optimize the software release policy under field-testing (FT) and no field-testing (NFT) frameworks. The relevance of the optimization problem is illustrated using a numerical example, comprising both the exponential and S-shaped bug-detection process.",

In this paper, we apply two-sided matching decision-making process in game theory to traffic scheduling problem in data center network. From the perspective of matching between flow and path, the traffic scheduling is properly arranged. We first propose and model the path-flow matching problem, considering the preference ordering, then formulate the problem as a multiobjective optimization problem with the target to ensure the stability and satisfaction from the matching scheme, and design a preference-based path-flow ordering method Extended PIAS, and finally propose a lightweight scheduling algorithm LinkGame based on multiobjective evolutionary algorithm. Compared with the previous scheduling methods (ECMP, Hedera, and Fincher), experiment results demonstrate that LinkGame can simultaneously consider the stability and satisfaction of the matching results, with improved bandwidth utilization and flow completion time.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "The single-period unit commitment problem has significant applications in electricity markets. An efficient global algorithm not only provides the optimal schedule that achieves the lowest cost, but also plays an important role for deriving the market-clearing price. As of today, the problem is mainly solved by using a general-purpose mixed-integer quadratic programming solver such as CPLEX or Gurobi. This paper proposes an extremely efficient global optimization algorithm for solving the problem. We propose a conjugate function based convex relaxation and design a special dual algorithm to compute a tight lower bound of the problem in \n                \n                  \n                \n                $${\\mathcal {O}}(n\\log n)$$\n                \n               complexity. Then, a branch-and-bound algorithm is designed for finding a global solution to the problem. Computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm solves test instances with 500 integer variables in less than 0.01 s, whereas current state-of-the-art solvers fail to solve the same test instances in one hour. This superior performance of the proposed algorithm clearly indicates its potential in day-ahead and real-time electricity markets.",

Six hundred and sixty-eight college students were invited to complete a self-reported questionnaire measuring TAM constructs and three hypothesized variables drawn from MOOC characteristics. The results from path analysis showed that all path coefficients were statistically significant. Perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment significantly affected students' behavioral intention to use MOOCs, while both perceived usefulness and behavioral intention yielded a significant influence on perceived effective use of MOOCs. Usability and perceived quality had a strong indirect impact on behavioral intention and perceived effective use through the mediators of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment. This study demonstrated that the extended TAM with MOOC characteristics provides an effective means to understand students' acceptance of MOOCs.",

However, the energy is a major challenge in the WSN environment as the battery-operated sensor nodes in the network consumes huge amount of energy during transmission. This work addresses the energy issue and provides an energy efficient multi-hop routing in WSN named Taylor based Cat Salp Swarm Algorithm (Taylor C-SSA) by modifying C-SSA with Taylor series. This method undergoes two stages for attaining multi-hop routing, which includes selection of cluster head (CH), and transmission of data. Initially, the energy-efficient cluster heads are selected using the Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol for effective data transmission, the sensor nodes sends data over the CH, which transmits the data to the base station through the selected optimal hop. The optimal hop selection is done using the proposed Taylor C-SSA. Moreover, the security aware multi-hop routing is performed by introducing trust model that involves indirect trust, integrity factor, direct trust, and data forwarding rate. The proposed Taylor C-SSA algorithm shows best performance in terms of energy, number of alive nodes, delay, and throughput values of 0.129, 42, 0.291, and 0.1, respectively.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is comprised of numerous devices connected through wired or wireless networks, including sensors and actuators. Recently, the number of IoT applications has increased dramatically, including smart homes, vehicular ad hoc network (VANETs), health care, smart cities, and wearables. As reported in IHS Markit (see ), the number of connected devices is projected to jump from approximately 27 billion in 2017 to 125 billion in 2030, an average annual increment of 12%. Security is a critical issue in today's IoT field because of the nature of the architecture, the types of devices, different methods of communication (mainly wireless), and the volume of data being transmitted over the network. Security becomes even more important as the number of devices connected to the IoT increases. To overcome the challenges of securing IoT devices, we propose a new deep learning-based intrusion detection system (DL-IDS) to detect security threats in IoT environments. There are many IDSs in the literature, but they lack optimal features learning and data set management, which are significant issues that affect the accuracy of attack detection. Our proposed module combines the spider monkey optimization (SMO) algorithm and the stacked-deep polynomial network (SDPN) to achieve optimal detection recognition; SMO selects the optimal features in the data sets and SDPN classifies the data as normal or anomalies. The types of anomalies detected by DL-IDS include denial of service (DoS), user-to-root (U2R) attack, probe attack, and remote-to-local (R2L) attack. Extensive analysis indicates that the proposed DL-IDS achieves better performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score.",

One collects previous cases, called \"scenarios\", for the set-up in which optimization is being performed, and makes a decision that is optimal for the cases that have been collected. For convex optimization, a solid theory has been developed that provides guarantees of performance, and constraint satisfaction, of the scenario solution. In this paper, we open a new direction of investigation: the risk that a performance is not achieved, or that constraints are violated, is studied jointly with the complexity (as precisely defined in the paper) of the solution. It is shown that the joint probability distribution of risk and complexity is concentrated in such a way that the complexity carries fundamental information to tightly judge the risk. This result is obtained without requiring extra knowledge on the underlying optimization problem than that carried by the scenarios; in particular, no extra knowledge on the distribution by which scenarios are generated is assumed, so that the result is broadly applicable. This deep-seated result unveils a fundamental and general structure of data-driven optimization and suggests practical approaches for risk assessment.",

In addition, we study whether it matters that the distribution selection method does not accurately pick the correct probability distribution by calculating the expected distance, which is the amount of information lost for each distribution selection method compared to the generating probability distribution.",

A set D of vertices in G is a semitotal dominating set of G if D is a dominating set of G and every vertex in D is within distance 2 from another vertex of D. Given a graph G and a positive integer k, the semitotal domination problem is to decide whether G has a semitotal dominating set of cardinality at most k. The semitotal domination problem is known to be NP-complete for chordal graphs and bipartite graphs as shown in [M.A. Henning and A. Pandey, Algorithmic aspects of semitotal domination in graphs, Theoret. Comput. Sci. 766 (2019) 46-57]. In this paper, we present a linear time algorithm to compute a minimum semitotal dominating set in block graphs.

Cellverse is being designed by the Collaborative Learning Environments in Virtual Reality (CLEVR) team, an interdisciplinary team consisting of game designers, educational researchers, and graduate and undergraduate students. Using a design-based research approach, we have enlisted the help of both subject matter experts and user testers to iteratively design and improve Cellverse. The objective of this paper is to share how user and expert feedback can inform and enhance the development of learning games. We describe how we gather and synthesize information to review and revise our game from in-game observations, semi-structured interviews, and video data. We discuss the input of subject matter experts, present feedback from our user testers, and describe how input from both parties influenced the design of Cellverse. Our results suggest that including feedback from both experts and users has provided information that can clarify gameplay, instruction, subject portrayal, narrative, and in-game goals.",

We propose several robust alternatives for the covariance matrix, which are constructed by combining robust correlation estimators with robust variation measures. Through extensive numerical studies we demonstrate the robust performance of our proposed approaches compared to the standard methods based on the sample covariance matrix. Further, we apply our proposals to a real data application, aimed at studying the optimal portfolio allocations in Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite index.

In the first part of this paper we give some general lower and upper bounds for the rho-edge stability number. In the second part we study the chi'-edge stability number of graphs, where chi' = chi'(G) is the chromatic index of G. We prove some general results for the so-called chromatic edge stability index es(chi')(G) and determine es(chi')(G) exactly for specific classes of graphs.",

We hypothesize that two inter-channel similarity features, correlation coefficients and linear predictive coefficients, are able to detect the PD signals automatically using support vector machines classifier with third degree polynomial kernel. A progressive feature addition analysis is employed using selected features obtained based on the feature ranking and principal component analysis techniques. The proposed approach is able to achieve a maximum accuracy of 99.1 +/- 0.1%.

In this paper, we propose an Energy Efficient Distributed Lightweight Authentication and Encryption (EEDLAE) technique for IoT security. In our proposed technique, the receiver generates the token for each sender. The token expiration time is determined based on the trust value of each sender, and sleep period of the receiver radio is determined based on its remaining energy. For encryption, Counter with Cipher Block Chaining-Message Authentication Code (CCM) is applied. Experimental results show that EEDLAE technique can hold out against affected packets, higher resilience against node capture, increased throughput, and residual energy, compared with the existing technique.",

The proposed biometric cryptosystem has two phases: enrolment and verification. Each of them comprises three main stages: feature extraction, reliable components extraction, and fuzzy commitment scheme. Gait features are extracted from gait images using local ternary pattern (LTP), and then, the average of one complete gait cycle using the gait energy image (GEl) concept is calculated. The average images are joined using a 2D joint histogram, which is reduced using principal component analysis (PCA) to produce the final feature vector. To enhance the robustness of the system, only highly robust and reliable bits from the feature vector are extracted. Finally, the fuzzy commitment scheme is used to secure feature templates. Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquenghem codes (BCH) are used for key encoding in the enrolment phase and for decoding in the verification phase. The proposed system is tested using the CMU MoBo and CASIA A databases. The experimental results show that the best error rate for the CMU MoBo database is obtained when using a fast walk for enrolment and verification, where we obtain 0% for the false acceptance rate (FAR) and 0% for the false rejection rate (FRR) for a key length equal to 50 bits. The best error rate for CASIA A dataset is obtained when using the 45-degree direction to the image plane view for enrolment and verification, where we obtain 0% for the false acceptance rate (FAR) and 0% for the false rejection rate (FRR) for a key length equal to 45 bits.",

Biological constraints were also considered. Exact methods, based on the nonlinear model and on a linearization of that model were proposed to generate Pareto optimal solutions for the problem of sustainable cultivation, along with a metaheuristic approach for the problem based on a genetic algorithm and on constructive heuristics. The methods were tested using semi-randomly generated instances to simulate real situations. According to the experimental results, the exact methodologies performed favorably for small and medium size instances. The heuristic method was able to potentially determine Pareto optimal solutions of good quality, in a reduced computational time, even for high dimension instances. Therefore, the mathematical models and the methods proposed may support a powerful methodology for this complex decision-making problem.",

Unsatisfied scenarios can enter a recovery mode. This class corresponds to problems that can be reformulated as deterministic convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems with indicator variables and continuous scenario variables, but the size of the reformulation is large and quickly becomes impractical as the number of scenarios grows. The Branch-and-Cut algorithm is based on an implicit Benders decomposition scheme, where we generate cutting planes as outer approximation cuts from the projection of the feasible region on suitable subspaces. The size of the master problem in our scheme is much smaller than the deterministic reformulation of the chance-constrained problem. We apply the Branch-and-Cut algorithm to the mid-term hydro scheduling problem, for which we propose a chance-constrained formulation. A computational study using data from ten hydroplants in Greece shows that the proposed methodology solves instances faster than applying a general-purpose solver for convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems to the deterministic reformulation, and scales much better with the number of scenarios.",

In this regard, BPMN collaborations provide a suitable modelling abstraction. Even if this is a widely accepted notation, only a limited effort has been expended in formalising its semantics, especially for what it concerns the interplay among control features, data handling and exchange of messages in scenarios requiring multiple instances of interacting participants. In this paper, we face the problem of providing a formal semantics for BPMN collaborations including elements dealing with multiple instances, i.e., multi-instance pools and sequential/parallel multi-instance tasks. For an accurate account of these features, it is necessary to consider the data perspective of collaboration models, thus supporting data objects, data collections and data stores, and different execution modalities of tasks concerning atomicity and concurrency. Beyond defining a novel formalisation, we also provide a BPMN collaboration animator tool, named MIDA, faithfully implementing the formal semantics. MIDA can also support designers in debugging multi-instance collaboration models.",

Students used the interactive map to make scientific observations for an evidence-based hypothesis. The examination of classification error using an artificial neural network, compared against the majority class for prediction, suggests that student performance on several metrics of critical thinking can be classified based on different patterns in interactions with visual representations. Two alternative methods are compared in this study for training and evaluating data-mined models of student performance. In accordance with the general consensus in the literature, the error estimates for models' predictions were less variable using a student-level cross-validation. Implications of these findings for open-ended inquiry-based learning environments are discussed.",

Therefore, state-of-the-art techniques need to be developed in order to accurately predict the energy loss in electrical machines for their improved performance. To this end, machine learning techniques have been employed to predict accurate energy loss at different frequencies and induction levels under rotational conditions. Such types of flux exist near the teeth of the stator in synchronous machines. In transformers, rotational flux arises at the bends and corners of the stators. It was observed that the random forest machine learning algorithm has the least mean square error and as such is the most suited algorithm, which can be used for the accurate prediction of energy loss in nonoriented materials.",

EEG signals of emotions are not unique and it varies from person to person as each one has different emotional responses to the same stimuli. Thus EEG signals are subject dependent and proved to be effective for subject dependent emotion recognition. However, subject independent emotion recognition plays an important role in situations like emotion recognition from paralyzed or burnt face, where EEG of emotions of the subjects before the incidents are not available to build the emotion recognition model. Hence there is a need to identify common EEG patterns corresponds to each emotion independent of the subjects. In this paper, a subject independent emotion recognition technique is proposed from EEG signals using Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) as a feature extraction technique and Deep Neural Network as the classifier. The performance evaluation of the proposed method with the benchmark DEAP dataset shows that the combination of VMD and Deep Neural Network performs better compared to the state of the art techniques in subject-independent emotion recognition from EEG.",

Also, the obtained methods enable to compute approximate solutions of the equations on any given time interval and, therefore, enable to carry out the numerical analysis of global dynamics of the corresponding mathematical models. The examples demonstrating the capabilities of the developed methods are provided. To construct the methods we use the spectral projectors, Taylor expansions and finite differences. Since the used spectral projectors can be easily computed, to apply the methods it is not necessary to carry out additional analytical transformations.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common aggressive cancer in women while the early detection of this cancer can reduce the aggressiveness. But it is challenging to identify breast cancer features such as micro-calcification from mammogram images by the human eye because of its size and appearance. Therefore, the automatic detection of micro-calcification is essential for diagnosis and proper treatment. This work introduces an automated approach and segments any micro-calcification in the mammogram images. At first, the preprocessing applications of images are applied to enhance the image. After that, the breast region is segmented from the pectoral region. The suspicious regions are detected using fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm and divided them into negative and positive patches. This procedure eliminates the manual labelling of the region of interest. The positive patches which contain micro-calcification pixels are taken to train a modified U-net segmentation network. Finally, the trained network is utilised to segment the micro-calcification area automatically from the mammogram images. This process can help as an assistant to the radiologist for early diagnosis and increase the segmentation accuracy of the micro-calcification regions. The proposed system is trained up with a Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM), which is prepared by the University of South Florida, USA. We obtain 98.5% F-measure and 97.8% Dice score respectively. Besides, Jaccard index is 97.4%. The average accuracy of the proposed method is 98.2% which provides better performance than state-of-the-art methods. This work can be embedded with the real-time mammography system.",

This paper investigates the estimation problem when lifetimes are the two-parameter Lindley distributed and are collected under two removal patterns based on the uniform discrete distribution and the binomial distribution. The maximum likelihood estimations (MLEs) of parameters are obtained by a derivative-free optimization method and without applying the logarithm of the likelihood function. Furthermore, we propose a method for starting values of optimization to obtain the MLEs and compare numerically their bias, variance, covariance and mean squared error under the two different removal plans. Then, the expected times are discussed and compared numerically under the two approaches of generating random removals. Finally, the optimal progressive Type-II censoring scheme is provided based on the measure of the smallest expected experiment time.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "A distributionally robust joint chance constraint involves a set of uncertain linear inequalities which can be violated up to a given probability threshold epsilon, over a given family of probability distributions of the uncertain parameters. A conservative approximation of a joint chance constraint, often referred to as a Bonferroni approximation, uses the union bound to approximate the joint chance constraint by a system of single chance constraints, one for each original uncertain constraint, for a fixed choice of violation probabilities of the single chance constraints such that their sum does not exceed epsilon. It has been shown that, under various settings, a distributionally robust single chance constraint admits a deterministic convex reformulation. Thus the Bonferroni approximation approach can be used to build convex approximations of distributionally robust joint chance constraints. In this paper we consider an optimized version of Bonferroni approximation where the violation probabilities of the individual single chance constraints are design variables rather than fixed a priori. We show that such an optimized Bonferroni approximation of a distributionally robust joint chance constraint is exact when the uncertainties are separable across the individual inequalities, i.e., each uncertain constraint involves a different set of uncertain parameters and corresponding distribution families. Unfortunately, the optimized Bonferroni approximation leads to NP-hard optimization problems even in settings where the usual Bonferroni approximation is tractable. When the distribution family is specified by moments or by marginal distributions, we derive various sufficient conditions under which the optimized Bonferroni approximation is convex and tractable. We also show that for moment based distribution families and binary decision variables, the optimized Bonferroni approximation can be reformulated as a mixed integer second-order conic set. Finally, we demonstrate how our results can be used to derive a convex reformulation of a distributionally robust joint chance constraint with a specific nonseparable distribution family.",

As a result, a growing amount of fresh fruits and vegetables has to be transported from predominantly rural production regions to customers mostly located in urban ones. Specific handling and storage conditions need to be respected along the entire supply chain to maintain high quality and product value. To support organic food logistics operations, this work investigates benefits of facilitating real-time product data along delivery and storage processes. By the development of a simulation-based decision support system, sustainable deliveries of organic food from farms to retail stores are investigated. Generic keeping quality models are integrated to observe impacts of varying storage temperatures on food quality and losses over time. Computational experiments study a regional supply chain of organic strawberries in Lower Austria and Vienna. Results indicate that the consideration of shelf life data in supply chain decisions allow one to reduce food losses and further enables shifting surplus inventory to alternative distribution channels.",

In fact, container resource allocation is the major key hole for cloud providers since it directly influences the resource consumption and system performance. In this manner, this paper introduces a new optimized container resource allocation model by proposing a new optimization concept. To make the possibility of optimal container resource allocation, a new hybridized algorithm is implanted; namely, Whale Random update assisted Lion Algorithm (WR-LA), which is the hybrid form of Lion Algorithm (LA) and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is introduced. Moreover, the solution of optimized resource allocation is made by considering objectives like Threshold Distance, Balanced Cluster Use, System Failure, and Total Network Distance, respectively. Finally, the performance of the proposed model is compared over other conventional models and proves its superiority.",

The model has embedded constraints based on a support factor parameter that ensure a minimum support for the base of items. The solutions obtained from the model are then evaluated by a procedure that verifies the conditions for the static stability. Computational tests were performed on a large variety of randomly generated instances, and the outputs were assessed by means of regression analysis (linear and logistic). The results show which characteristics of the instances contribute directly and inversely to the probability of obtaining statically stable packing patterns. This outcome may be useful to guide the choice of support factor values in some practical contexts.",

The matheuristic considers a local search technique with an adaptive perturbation mechanism to assign the classes to different knapsacks, and then once the assignment is identified, applies the IP to select the items to allocate to each knapsack. Experimental results obtained on a wide set of benchmark instances clearly show the competitiveness of the proposed approach compared to the best state-of-the-art solving techniques.",

These problems look for a subset of rectangular items of maximum value that can be cut from a single rectangular container. Guillotine constraints seek to ensure that items are arranged in such a way that cuts from one edge of the container to the opposite edge completely separate them. In particular, we consider the possibility of 2, 3, and 4 cutting stages in a predefined sequence. These constraints are considered within a two-level iterative approach that combines the resolution of integer linear programming and constraint programming models. Experiments with instances of the literature are carried out, and the results show that the proposed approach can solve in less than 500 s approximately 60% and 50% of the instances for the two- and three-dimensional cases, respectively. For the two-dimensional case, in comparison with the recent literature, it was possible to improve the upper bound for 16% of the instances.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "Because the weighted total least squares (WTLS) method lacks robustness and is sensitive to gross errors, it cannot eliminate the influence of outliers effectively. A small number of gross errors may produce a devastating effect on estimates. Focusing on the limitation of the WTLS method regarding the influence of gross errors, this work combines Jackknife resampling theory with the WTLS algorithm for the identification and detection of outliers. The gross errors located in the WTLS method by the Jackknife method are identified to further improve the qualities of the estimated values if the observation data are falsified by outliers. This paper focuses on the following two aspects: only one gross error and multiple gross errors. Detailed calculation steps and the whole procedure for outlier detection using the new method are given. This algorithm is applied to the straight-line fitting model and the plane coordinate transformation model. From the experimental estimation results, we can see that the method proposed in this paper can identify gross errors that are greater than or equal to three times the standard error, and obtain more accurate estimation values when compared with the WTLS method and the classic robust weighted total least squares (RWTLS) method. The numerical case studies verify the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed procedure.",

The proposed system is a layered architecture composed of data collection and energy management, data computation, and decision-making layers. Energy-efficient clustering algorithm and optimized sleeping scheduling methods are utilized in the first layer to collect data from IoT devices with regard to energy management. The second layer is responsible for computation of data resourcefully along with energy efficiency. The third layer is used to provide valuable insights and make intelligent decisions. The architecture is verified with reliable datasets related to smart parking using IoT devices to test and reveal the effectiveness. The assessments disclose that the proposed scheme presents precious insights in the context of energy efficiency in sustainable cities and societies.",

Organic food is data-enabled with the organic label, but the certification cost discourages small-scale suppliers from certifying their product. This lack of a label means that product that satisfies the organic standard is regarded as conventional product. By considering the trade-off between the profit gained from organic label and additional costs of certification, this paper investigates an organic food supply chain where a leading retailer procures from two suppliers with different brands. Customers care about both the brand-value and quality (more specifically, if food is organic or not) when purchasing the product. We explore the organic certification and wholesale pricing strategies for suppliers, and the supplier selection and retail pricing strategies for the retailer. We find that when two suppliers adopt asymmetric certification strategy, the retailer tends to procure the product with organic label. The supplier without a brand name can compensate with organic certification, which leads to more profits than the branded rival. As the risk of being abandoned by the retailer increases, the supplier without a brand name is more eager than the rival to obtain the organic label. If both suppliers certify the product, however, they will fall into a prisoner’s dilemma under situation with low health utility from organic label and high certification cost.",

These weak points make them difficult to play a role in scenarios with high real-time and high data confidentiality requirements, for example, vehicle ad hoc network (VANET). Therefore, we proposed a verifiable hidden policy CP-ABE with decryption testing scheme (or VHPDT, for short). It has the following features: hidden policy to privacy-preserving and outsourced decryption testing can verify the correctness of the decrypted result. Furthermore, we apply it into VANET.",

In this article, we have proposed an improved 3-in-1 fused protein similarity measure called FuSim-II. It is built upon combining the weighted average of biological knowledge extracted from three potential genomic/ proteomic resources such as Gene Ontology (GO), PPIN, and protein sequence. Furthermore, we have shown the application of the proposed measure in detecting potential hub-proteins from a given PPIN. Aiming that, we have proposed a multi-objective clustering-based protein hub detection framework with FuSim-II working as the underlying proximity measure. The PPINs of H. Sapiens and M. Musculus organisms are chosen for experimental purposes. Unlike most of the existing hub-detection methods, the proposed technique does not require to follow any protein degree cut-off or threshold to define hubs. A thorough assessment of efficiency between proposed and existing eight protein similarity measures along with eight single/multi-objective clustering methods has been carried out. Internal cluster validity indices like Silhouette and Davies Bouldin (DB) are deployed to accomplish analytical study. Also, a comparative performance analysis between proposed and five existing hub-proteins detection algorithms is conducted through the enrichment of essentiality study. The reported results show the improved performance of FuSim-II over existing protein similarity measures in terms of identifying functionally related proteins as well as relevant hub-proteins.

The normal risk priority number (RPN) method, however, has suffers from a lot of criticisms, such as requirement of precise risk estimation, lack of scientific basis in computing RPN, and neglecting the weights of risk factors. Therefore, this paper devises a new FMEA model to evaluate and prioritize the risk of failure modes by integrating probabilistic linguistic term sets and TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese for interactive multi-criteria decision making) method. The probabilistic linguistic term sets are utilized to handle the intrinsic ambiguity existed in the risk assessments of FMEA team members, whilst an extended TODIM method is employed for determining the priority ranking of the individuated failure modes. Further, based on the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), an objective weighting method is presented to derive the relative weights of risk factors. Finally, two illustrative examples are implemented and comparisons with other existing methods are performed to demonstrate the rationality and superiority of our proposed FMEA model.",

Segregation of CT images as benign, malignant and non-cancerous is essential for early detection of lung cancers to improve survival rates. In this paper, a methodology for automated tumor stage classification of pulmonary lung nodules is proposed using an end-to-end learning Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). The images used in the study were acquired from the Lung Image Database Consortium and Infectious Disease Research Institute (LIDC-IDRI) public repository comprising of 1018 cases. Lung CT images with candidate nodules are segmented into a 52 × 52 pixel nodule region of interest (NROI) rectangle based on four radiologists’ annotations and markings with ground truth (GT) values. The approach aims in analyzing and extracting the self-learned salient features from the NROI consisting of differently structured nodules. DCNN are trained with NROI samples and are further classified according to the tumor patterns as non-cancerous, benign or malignant samples. Data augmentation and dropouts are used to avoid overfitting. The algorithm was compared with the state of art methods and traditional hand-crafted features like the statistical, texture and morphological behavior of lung CT images. A consistent improvement in the performance of the DCNN was observed using nodule grouped dataset and the classification accuracy of 97.8%, the specificity of 97.2%, the sensitivity of 97.1%, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) score of 0.9956 was achieved with reduced low false positives.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "Background: Ensemble biclustering comprises a class of biclustering algorithms that generates a consensus, better-quality partition/s as output. This concept has emerged from the fusion of existing biclustering methods hybridized upon selected aspects. The design of the methodology enriches the existing methods furnishing with new properties. Usually biclustering of gene expression microarray data indulges in simultaneous clustering of the expression profiles under specific conditions and determines local twoway clustering models. In general, biclustering solutions rely upon different parameters like biclusters numbers, random initialization etc. However ensemble techniques are proposed to either reduce or eliminate the impact of such parameters on the output bicluster. Methods: In this paper, the authors propose a novel ensemble biclustering approach \"Ensemble Neighborhood search (ENS)\" based on the concept of neighborhood search. Simulation results verify that the proposed approach appears to be more flexible and adaptive in comparison to the existing competitive methods on high-dimensional gene expression microarray data as well as on scRNA-seq datasets. Conclusion: The performance of the proposed framework demonstrates its effectiveness with the other state-of-the-art schemes. The proposed framework is tested on five different microarray datasets and one single cell RNA sequence(scRNA-seq) dataset. Experimental results reveal that the proposed architecture achieves the prevention of unusual data loss and delivers the output refined as the per user standards. Also this framework preforms effectively on high sparsity scRNA-seq data where most of the algorithms fail to do so as these datasets contain massive zeros within. BicAT analysis of the ENS output validates ENS method as computationally effective and can be used to improve the quality of the biclusters. Finally, the results are statistically significant as shown in the ANOVA table.

        "original_csv_abstract": "In most low- and middle-income countries supported by the World Health Organization's Expanded Program on Immunization, vaccines are distributed through a legacy medical supply chain that is typically not cost-efficient. Vaccines require storage and transport in a temperature-controlled environment; this requires a \"cold\" distribution chain with capacity constraints on cold storage and cold transport. We propose an approach to redesigning the vaccine distribution chain that includes locating a set of intermediate distribution centers (DCs) and determining the flow paths from the central store (where vaccines are received into a country) through one or more of these to health clinics where vaccination actually occurs. In addition, the transport vehicles to allocate to each flow path, and the cold storage devices to use at each clinic or intermediate DC are determined. The redesigned network does not have to follow the current four-tiered, arborescent structure commonly found in practice, but can use alternative network structures. To redesign this network optimally, we develop a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model that can be used for small-to-medium-sized problems and also present a hybrid heuristic-MIP method to obtain good solutions for larger problems. Numerical results are shown using data reflecting distribution networks in several countries in sub-Saharan Africa.",

This issue can be efficiently tackled by adopting the mechanism of clustering in sensor networks.

This achievement is made through the election of a single deserving node as a head node called cluster head. This paper suggested an evolutionary approach based clustering protocol named Modified-Invasive Weed Optimization Based Clustering Algorithm (M-IWOCA) for WSNs. M-IWOCA focuses on the selection of fittest node as a cluster head to enhance the network’s lifetime as well as to address the issue of energy conservation in sensor networks. A fuzzy inference model is designed to evaluate the fitness of each node in the network. Simulation results for M-IWOCA depict significant reduction in dead nodes per round and results in minimizing the energy utilization of the sensors. Moreover, M-IWOCA enhances the network stability period by 45% in comparison to Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) protocol and by 18% in comparison to Quantum Artificial Bee Colony (QABC) protocol.",

Years of research has established it is vital to capture, analyze and prioritize requirements, which to a great extent relies on acknowledgment acceptance of stakeholder’s requirements, concerns and criteria’s. Proposed method provides interactive support for eliciting stakeholders and developer’s initial ranking decision in collaborative manner. Intuitionistic Fuzzy Approach (IFS) is used to support stakeholders view; whereas analysis of inter relationships, requirement slicing and backtracking are used to support developers view using weighted page rank algorithm. Finally a ranking is generated in a collaborative manner to support requirement prioritization. The feasibility of the approach is illustrated through an experimental proof of concept by comparing results of proposed approach with state of art, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Interactive Genetic Algorithm (IGA) prioritization techniques. Results of experimentation conclude that presented approach is capable of producing accurate and comparable results by handling technical constraints of dependency, tradeoffs of collaboration and scope of inclusion of initial multi-criteria preferences expressed as priority values to support reliability and robustness to errors.",

To apply the existing methods for analyzing the data, for example, to estimate the variance and/or statistical inference will probably produce invalid results because these methods do not account for the uncertainty of imputations. In this article, we present analytic techniques for inference from a dataset in which missing values have been replaced by the nearest neighbors imputation method. A simple and easy to use bootstrap algorithm that combines the nearest neighbors imputation with bootstrap resampling estimation, to obtain valid bootstrap inferences in a linear regression model is suggested. More specifically, imputing bootstrap samples in the exact same way as original data was imputed produces correct bootstrap estimates. Simulation results show the performance of our approach in different data structures.",

Bayesian predictive density for the Weibull-Pareto composite distribution is developed and is used to compute risk measures such as Value at Risk (VaR), Conditional Tail Expectation (CTE), Predictive Expectation (PE), Limited Predictive Expected value (LPE), Limited Predictive Variance (LPV), and Limited Predictive Tail-VaR (LPCTE). Accuracy of parameter estimates as well as the risk measures are assessed via simulation studies. It is shown that the informative Bayes estimates are consistently more accurate than ML and the non-informative Bayes estimates.

In this paper, we propose a test statistic that can be obtained by applying two successive orthogonal transformations to the response vector such that the components of the resulting new vector are uncorrelated variates having zero mean and a common variance. Consequently, two new tests are proposed. The first assumes the normality of the responses and is based on approximating the distribution of the test statistic as a weighted sum of chi-square variates. The second test is a distribution-free permutation test based on the same test statistic. Our simulation experiments indicate that both tests have empirical significance levels that are close to the chosen nominal level. The statistical power of the first test is studied analytically. Empirical power comparisons indicate that the first test outperforms recently developed tests. The second test also has a competitive performance among them. Using a real dataset, the use of the proposed tests is illustrated.",

In a view of the importance in monitoring the CV and the fact that most real-life data in process monitoring are multivariate in nature, this paper proposes to monitor the multivariate CV in short runs process by means of run rules (RR) control charts. A Markov chain model is established for designing the proposed charts. The statistical performances of the RR multivariate CV (MCV) and Shewhart MCV (SH MCV) charts are compared in terms of the truncated average run length and the expected truncated average run length. The results show that the proposed charts surpass the SH MCV chart for detecting small and moderate multivariate CV shifts. The implementation of the RR MCV chart in the short runs process is illustrated with an example using a real dataset.",

These problems make the segmentation and classification process difficult. In this research, we proposed an optimized colour feature (OCF) of lesion segmentation and deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)-based skin lesion classification. A hybrid technique is proposed to remove the artefacts and improve the lesion contrast. Then, colour segmentation technique is presented known as OCFs. The OCF approach is further improved by an existing saliency approach, which is fused by a novel pixel-based method. A DCNN-9 model is implemented to extract deep features and fused with OCFs by a novel parallel fusion approach. After this, a normal distribution-based high-ranking feature selection technique is utilized to select the most robust features for classification. The suggested method is evaluated on ISBI series (2016, 2017, and 2018) datasets. The experiments are performed in two steps and achieved average segmentation accuracy of more than 90% on selected datasets. Moreover, the achieve classification accuracy of 92.1%, 96.5%, and 85.1%, respectively, on all three datasets shows that the presented method has remarkable performance.",

Multiple reliable non identical merging suppliers send products to an intermediate storage area which can in turn feed a distribution centre with parallel identical reliable distribution channels. It is assumed that each merging supplier may have parallel identical reliable supply channels. The service rate of each supplier and each identical channel at the distribution centre is assumed to be exponentially distributed. The examined model is analyzed as a continuous time Markov process with discrete states. An algorithm that can create the system's transition probabilities matrix for any value of its parameters is presented and various performance measures are calculated. The comparison of the proposed method with simulation showed that the proposed algorithm provides very accurate estimations of the system's performance measures. Additionally the optimal values of the system's parameters to optimize its various performance measures are also explored thoroughly.",

The existing network protocols are insufficient for collecting the required digital evidence of cybercrime, which eventually makes the process of forensic investigation difficult. In the current scenario of network forensics, the investigator with current capabilities can reach only up to the ISP. This is not primary evidence. Currently, available tools work only at the network layer. In this work, we propose a protocol that ensures tracking up to the true source by collecting beforehand forensically sound evidence. The proposed protocol can collect target data from the device in the form of a device fingerprint with the help of an agent process. The proposed methodology will help in proving non-repudiation, which is a well-known challenge in forensic cases. The fingerprint evidence generated by the proposed method has the capability of not getting obsolete even if the criminal tries to destroy evidence. The fingerprinting technique deployed uses a hash tree and generates evidence in such a way that this fingerprint can act as legal evidence. The security validation of the proposed system is done using the BAN logic. Formal verification is performed using the AVISPA tool. The system has been implemented as a prototype and hosted on AWS.",

It mainly uses a crowded comparison method (CCM) to select the suitable individuals for enter the next generation. However, the CCM requires to need calculate the crowding distance of each individual, which needs to sort the population according to each objective function and it exhausts a lot of computational burdens. To better deal with this problem, we proposes an improved crowded comparison method (ICCM), which combines CCM with the random selection method (RSM) based on the number of selected individuals. The RSM is an operator that randomly selects the suitable individuals for the next generation according to the number of needed individuals, which can reduce the computational burdens significantly. The performance of ICCM is tested on two different benchmark sets (the ZDT test set and the UF test set). The results show that ICCM can reduce the computational burdens by controlling two different selection methods (i.e., CCM and RSM).",

The associated interval estimates are obtained using the Fisher information matrix and Chen and Shao method respectively under classical and Bayesian approaches. Further, the predictive point estimates and associated predictive interval estimates are computed by making use of best unbiased and conditional median predictors under classical approach, and Bayesian predictive and associated Bayesian predictive interval estimates in the problem of prediction.

More specifically, the relative performance of two monitoring schemes is evaluated in terms of their average time to signal (ATS) when aggregated and disaggregated information is used.

We propose a very efficient nonparametric Bayesian approach method to infer smooth density defined on (0,1) through the transformation of a random variable. For practical implementation, we provide the corresponding blocked Gibbs sampling procedure based on the stick-breaking representation. The greatest advantage of this method is that it does not require us to draw from the complete conditional posterior distribution using a Metropolis-Hastings transition probability because the proposed transformation leads to a pair of conjugate priors and likelihoods. The validity of the proposed method is assessed through simulated and real data analysis.",

Our analysis yielded interesting insights that show some of these factors play significant roles in predicting both student performance and their propensity to utilize resources that help improve their performance, such as additional support services. The predictive accuracy of both of our models were over 95% (error rate <5%). Moreover, quantile regression models were used to determine factors that specifically affect the performance of low-performing students so that targeted intervention and support services can be developed specifically for them. In conclusion, deeper analytics via statistical models are crucial for forming an in-depth understanding of how to improve student performance in a bottleneck course and this has far-reaching implications for both educators and administrators in higher education.",

With the formal freeze on 5G NSA standards, 5G networks are one step closer to our lives. In this paper, a centralized non-uniform clustering routing protocol C-EEUC based on the residual energy and communication cost. The C-EEUC protocol considers all nodes as candidate cluster heads in the clustering stage and defines a weight matrix P. The value of the matrix elements takes into account the residual energy of nodes and the cost of communication between nodes and cluster heads, selected as the basis for the cluster head. When selecting a cluster head, each time a node with the largest weight is selected from a set of candidate cluster heads, other candidate cluster heads within the competition range abandon competition, and then updates the candidate cluster head set. Experimental results show that the protocol optimized in this paper can effectively extend the network life cycle.",

This technique can perform extraction without the need to save edge detection on the original cover image. This is because edge detection is performed on 3-bits MSB images, whereas messages are embedded at x LSB and y LSB values, where x is the number of LSB bits replaced in the edge area and y is the number of bits replaced in the non-edge area, where x and y cannot reach 3-bits MSB, so the edge detection of the cover image and the stego image will be the same. Based on the results of tests carried out, the proposed steganography technique succeeded in improving the quality of imperceptibility, where the PSNR value increased by about 1 to 2 dB when compared to the previous method. Similarly, the message embedding capacity can be increased due to a wider edge area, with the same image dataset obtained an average increase of 4,350–12,364 pixels of the edge area, however, the quality of the stego image imperceptibility can be maintained.",

In this paper, we propose a novel topic sentiment joint model with word embeddings dependency based on recurrent neural network. The model introduces the dependency among word embedding and delivers topic information and sentiment information of words by a recurrent neural network. It fully extends the semantic information and redefines the topic sentiment-word distribution. Moreover, we obtain more accurate topic detection and sentiment analysis. Experimental results on online review data set show that the proposed model significantly improves the sentiment classification accuracy and achieved better topic detection compared with previous methods.",

The energy possessed by the sensor nodes needs to be optimally utilized in order to extend the lifetime expectancy with guaranteed QoS in the network. In this paper, a Hybrid Artificial Bee Colony and Monarchy Butterfly Optimization Algorithm (HABC-MBOA)-based Cluster Head Selection Scheme is proposed for the predominant selection of cluster heads under clustering process. This proposed HABC-MBOA replaces the employee bee phase of ABC with mutated butterfly adjusting operator of MBOA for preventing earlier trapping of solutions into a local optimal point and delayed convergence by maintaining the tradeoff between exploitation and exploration. This proposed HABC-MBOA plays an anchor role in eliminating inadequacy of ABC algorithm towards global search potential. This proposed HABC-MBOA also eliminates the possibility of cluster heads being overloaded with maximum number of sensor nodes, that results in rapid death of the sensor nodes during the deployment of impotent cluster head selection process. The simulation results confirmed that the number of alive nodes in the network is determined to be 18.92% superior to the benchmarked cluster head selection approaches.",

Therefore, it is critical to develop a predictive model capable of identifying areas with high crime intensity and detecting trends of crime occurrence in such areas for the allocation of scarce resources and investment in the prevention and reduction of criminal strategies. This study develops a predictive model based on K-means clustering, signal decomposition technique, and neural networks to identify crime distribution in urban areas and accurately forecast the variation tendency of the number of crimes in each area. We find that the time series of the number of crimes in different areas show a correlation in the long term, but this long-term effect cannot be reflected in the short period. Therefore, we argue that short-term joint law enforcement has no theoretical basis because data show that spatial heterogeneity and time lag cannot be timely reflected in short-term prediction. By combining the temporal and spatial effects, a high-precision anticrime information support system is designed, which can help the police to implement more targeted crime prevention strategies at the micro level.",

This paper intends to propose a new PPDM model that includes two phases: data sanitization and restoration. Initially, association rules get extracted for proceeding the mentioned phases. The first and foremost tactic on the proposed privacy preservation model is the generation of the optimal key that is used to produce the sanitized data from the original data. The same key takes complete responsibility for processing the data restoration process by the receiver. As the key extraction plays a major role, this paper intends to propose a new hybrid algorithm; Trial based update on whale and particle swarm algorithm (TU-WPA) for selecting the optimal key. The proposed method is the combination of particle swarm optimization and whale optimization algorithm. More importantly, the research issues such as hiding failure rate, information preservation rate, false rule generation and degree of modification are minimized through the proposed sanitization and restoration processes. Finally, the performance of the proposed TU-WPA model is verified over other conventional models.",

However, the mechanisms for healthcare are challenging and dynamic processes to gain a clear insight or understanding of patient care. In this paper, we proposed a new approach of architecture and optimization of data mining modeling for visualization of knowledge extraction by analyzing clinical data sets to define the determinant attributes through modeling techniques. Therefore, architecture for the visualization of the knowledge extraction process is a systematic approach to support users to the best of their knowledge of the issues over the challenge of visualizing techniques. The proposed approach is capable and dynamic to handle and analyze large-scale data in its dimension and context. Such a variable is defined using various techniques to characterize them towards the detection of determinant variables as its influential circumstance. We focused on modeling based visualization as model representation, factor's interaction and integration. The detection process experimented in a different approach and justification as discussed in section five. The finding showed a deep understandability for an advanced and dynamic data mining modeling techniques to integrate applications with domain contexts for the optimal and understandable decision process. The strength of this approach is the depth for visualization towards the knowledge extraction process and its understandability for users as per their background and circumstances. It is also essential to inference for architecture based modeling and visualization for large scale data. Researchers, physicians, experts, and other users are the potentials to refer to these novel ideas and findings.",

Four derived themes have been found to describe the design and implementation of CAUL, including learner-centeredness, technological facilitation, learning ecology, and research evaluation. The learning processes enabled by context-aware sensing technology have been explicated, revealing specific ways to apply new technologies in formal and informal environments. The analysis based on intended learning outcomes suggest that more efforts should be directed to fostering competence in analyzing and creating in mandatory education, and to creating in tertiary settings. Finally, unequal distribution of CAUL implementation across world regions calls for more technological appropriation in Southeast Asia and Africa. Specific suggestions on how to improve CAUL are also provided to better prepare learners in the twenty-first century.",

This conceptual paper sets out to update and expand existing approaches to the civic role of video games by offering a \"connected civic gaming\" framework. Connected civic gaming brings together two approaches: first, \"connected civics\" highlights the potential of digital technologies to create consequential connections between youth's interest driven cultural participation and civic modes of action. Second, \"connected gaming\" stresses the importance of positioning youth not only as game-players but also as makers of video games and active participants in the emerging communities that surround them. Accordingly, we offer a classification of the diverse civic contributions of game-playing and making, calling for two main shifts in research on civic video games: (1) overcoming the depiction of games as standalone interventions, and integrating them in broader educational efforts; and (2) a stronger emphasis on offering youth decision making power in- and about the games they play.",

As the digitalization of world, heterogeneous devices, and with the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT), these IoT devices produce different type of data with distinct frequency, which require real-time and latency sensitive services. This provides great challenge to cloud computing framework. Fog computing is a new framework to accompaniment cloud platform and is proposed to extend services to the edge of the network. In fog computing, the entire user's tasks are offloaded to distributed fog nodes to the edge of network to avoid delay sensitivity. We select fog computing network dwell different set of fog nodes to provide required services to the users. Allocation of defined resource to the users in order to achieve optimal result is a big challenge. Therefore, we propose dynamic resource allocation strategy for cloud, fog node, and users. In the framework, we first formulate the ranks of fog node using TOPSIS to identify most suitable fog node for the incoming request. Simultaneously logistic regression calculates the load of individual fog node and updates the result to send back to the broker for next decision. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme undoubtedly improves the performance and give accuracy of 98.25%.",

The execution of real-time interactive tasks constitutes an important part of CC. Thus, we propose, in this paper, a real-time server load prediction system based on incoming task classification and VM interference detection. The incoming task classification is used to capture the incoming workload trend and VM interference detection aims to capture the interference rate. Finally, load prediction considers server actual resources’ usage, VM interference rate, and incoming workload trend. We propose an improved version of Hoeffding Adaptive Tree (HAT), augmented by ensemble drift detectors. Results show that our Real-Time Server Load Prediction System (RTSLPS) was able to deliver great flexibility dealing with changes and very good accuracy with quick evaluation time and a small memory footprint.",

An optimal cut-off point is required to discriminate healthy from diseased individuals, and a corresponding biomarker value is used to assess the accuracy and robustness whether a person is healthy (negative) or diseased (positive). If the biomarker values, that are greater than or equal to this cut-off value, are considered positive, otherwise they are negative. Several indices such as Youden index, Euclidean index, product of sensitivity and specificity have been used in clinical practices but their reliability of performance are not well understood by clinicians. This study uses Taguchi quality loss function to compare the choice of methods in determining optimal cut-off points for the diagnostic tests. The results illustrate that the variance of diseased populations is less than the variance of healthy populations and the loss coefficient of false negative results is greater than loss coefficient of the false positive results, the Youden index has a better performance; in other cases, the Euclidean index is a better measure. This paper proposes a Taguchi index based on the quality loss function can measure the diagnostic accuracy for differences in the sensitivity and specificity by minimizing the cost of false positive and false negative results. The proposed index can assess diagnostic tests and offer perfect discrimination.",

In this study, we model the vehicle scheduling problem of Metrobus as a multiple depot vehicle scheduling problem. The model aims to minimize the fleet size and total deadhead kilometers while covering all timetabled trips. We propose a new heuristic, trips merger (TM), to solve the model and show that there exists cost reduction opportunities in terms of both fleet size and deadhead kilometers. The proposed heuristic is a member of the state-space reduction heuristics family, which first reduces the problem size, then solves the reduced problem. Computational study reveals that TM performed better than the existing state-space reduction heuristics for the Metrobus case.",

When time is assumed to be discrete, the problem is known to be EXPSPACE-complete. However, the official PDDL 2.1 semantics and many implementations interpret time as a dense domain. This work provides several results about the complexity of the problem, focusing on some particularly interesting cases: whether a minimum amount ε of separation between mutually exclusive events is given, in contrast to the separation being simply required to be non-zero, and whether or not actions are allowed to overlap already running instances of themselves. We prove the problem to be PSPACE-complete when self-overlap is forbidden, whereas, when it is allowed, it becomes EXPSPACE-complete with ε-separation and even undecidable with non-zero separation. These results clarify the computational consequences of different choices in the definition at the core of the PDDL 2.1 semantics, which have been vague until now.1",

Influence maximization addresses the problem of identifying a k-size subset of nodes in a social network which can trigger a cascade of further adoptions, leading to maximum influence spread across the social network. In this paper, influence maximization has been proposed by combining a node’s connections and its actual past activity pattern. Analyzing node’s activity with respect to interaction frequency and self-similarity trend, provides a more realistic view of the node’s influence potential. Inspired by this concept, HAC-Rank algorithm has been proposed for identification of initial adopters based on both their connections and past behaviour. Furthermore, a Hurst-based Influence Maximization (HBIM) model for diffusion, wherein a node’s activation depends upon its connections and the self-similarity trend exhibited by its past activity, has also been proposed. For assessing the self-similarity trend in a node’s activity pattern, Hurst exponent (H) has been computed. Based on the results achieved, proposed algorithm has been found to perform better than other state-of-art algorithms for initial adopter identification.",

More services for personal health management of users are available and studies on the establishment of knowledge base for an efficient health log data management in the health care field are being carried out with the emergence of block chain technology which is the next generation information security technology. In this paper, a knowledge-based block chain network for health log data management mobile service is suggested. The user’s log data and context information are applied to block chain technology that is difficult to forge and falsify in the knowledge-based health platform, enabling a large amount of users’ log data and context information accumulated continuously to be stored in a block in the knowledge base using the side chain structure that stores information through the configuration of knowledge-based data transaction. This enables high expandability and security to be secured in mobile environment as well. The result of comparative evaluation with the existing ontology knowledge model for verifying the validity shows that the suggested method presented approximately 16.5% higher performance in accuracy and reproducibility.",

The work contributes a valuable input for researchers, academics, funding institutes and research administration departments by sharing the trends to set directions of research path. Design/methodology/approach The authors procure an innovative CFP data set to analyse scientific evolution and prestige of conferences that set scientific trends using scientific publications indexed in DBLP. Using the Field of Research code 804 from Australian Research Council, the authors identify 146 conferences (from 2006 to 2015) into different thematic areas by matching the terms extracted from publication titles with the Association for Computing Machinery Computing Classification System. Furthermore, the authors enrich the vocabulary of terms from the WordNet dictionary and Growbag data set. To measure the significance of terms, the authors adopt the following weighting schemas: probabilistic, gram, relative, accumulative and hierarchal. Findings The results indicate the rise of \"big data analytics\" from CFP topics in the last few years. Whereas the topics related to \"privacy and security\" show an exponential increase, the topics related to \"semantic web\" show a downfall in recent years. While analysing publication output in DBLP that matches CFP indexed in ERA Core A* to C rank conference, the authors identified that A* and A tier conferences not merely set publication trends, since B or C tier conferences target similar CFP. Originality/value Overall, the analyses presented in this research are prolific for the scientific community and research administrators to study research trends and better data management of digital libraries pertaining to the scientific literature.",

Mobile internet and social network are more and more deeply integrated into people's daily life, especially under the interaction of the fierce development momentum of the Internet of Things and diversified personalized services, more and more private information of social users is exposed to the network environment actively or unintentionally. In addition, a large amount of social network data not only brings more benefits to network application providers, but also provides motivation for malicious attackers. Therefore, under the social network environment, the research on the privacy protection of user information has great theoretical and practical significance. Design/methodology/approach In this study, based on the social network analysis, combined with the attribute reduction idea of rough set theory, the generalized reduction concept based on multi-level rough set from the perspectives of positive region, information entropy and knowledge granularity of rough set theory were proposed. Furthermore, it was traversed on the basis of the hierarchical compatible granularity space of the original information system and the corresponding attribute values are coarsened. The selected test data sets were tested, and the experimental results were analyzed. Findings The results showed that the algorithm can guarantee the anonymity requirement of data publishing and improve the effect of classification modeling on anonymous data in social network environment. Originality/value In this study, the proposed algorithm and scheme can effectively protect the privacy of social network data, ensure the availability of social network graph structure and realize the need of both protection and sharing of user attributes and relational data.",

This study addresses the network reliability, the probability that the given demand can travel from an origin to a destination within the time threshold and the travel cost after discount does not exceed the budget, to indicate travel agents’ ability on satisfying customers’ demand under specific constraints. To calculate the network reliability, this work develops an algorithm, which determines all lower boundary points via the minimal concept. An air transportation system of the travel agent is constructed as a flow-network consisting of sets of nodes (airports) and arcs (flights). On each flight, there exists a contracted airline providing the service with stochastic capacity and corresponding probability. The flow-network in this study is typical stochastic, called a stochastic-flow air transportation network. A real case for the proposed algorithm demonstration and some management suggestions of the network reliability are provided.",

In the literature, the focus has mainly been on aggregate reserving techniques and the chain-ladder method with its extensions has remained as the most widely applied claim reserving method. The classical chain-ladder method is regularly applied to annual data, but the question arises whether the reserve estimates based on more refined data outperform results obtained by annual data. We investigate whether and how much different data aggregation levels can improve the reserving process. To compare the performance of the classical chain-ladder method and its novel continuous extension, we conduct two simulation studies as well as a case study with an insurance data and use both models to estimate the IBNR claim count estimates on different levels of data aggregation. The results demonstrate that the continuous approach of the chain-ladder method provides in general a minor improvement in the IBNR predictions but proves to hold its predictive power on different types of data. This study highlights data aggregation levels in which the estimates of classical chain-ladder model outperforms the estimates obtained by the use of annual data, providing more insights for establishing accurate loss reserves.",

The objective function is the minimization of the total tardiness. The proposed hybrid heuristic is a Lagrangean relaxation integrated with the variable neighborhood search (VNS). The methodology can generate strong bounds, using the information of the Lagrangean multipliers to construct and perturb feasible solutions within the VNS framework. We compare its performance with previous hybrid approaches and find that the upper bounds obtained are optimal for several cases and tight for others. The methodology presents competitive results when compared with previous related works.",

It transforms the scalar time series into a two-dimensional space of amplitude (time series values) and a change of amplitude (increment). Subsequently, it uses this representation to plot the data. One figure is produced for each time series. In consequence, the time series classification problem is converted into the visual pattern recognition problem. This transformation allows applying a wide range of algorithms for standard pattern recognition – in this domain, there are more options to choose from than in the domain of time series classification. In this paper, we demonstrated the high effectiveness of the new method in a series of experiments on publicly available time series. We compare our results with several state-of-the-art approaches dedicated to time series classification. The new method is robust and stable. It works for time series of differing lengths and is easy to extend and alter. Even with a baseline variant presented in an empirical study in this paper, it achieves a satisfying classification accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed conversion of raw time series into images that are subjected to feature extraction opens the possibility to apply standard clustering algorithms.",

One figure is produced for each time series. In consequence, the time series classification problem is converted into the visual pattern recognition problem. This transformation allows applying a wide range of algorithms for standard pattern recognition–in this domain, there …",

It is an important and challenging process to be achieved in emotional interaction. Accordingly, this work introduces the emotion recognition system by proposing the Taylor series based Deep Belief Network (Taylor-DBN). The noise present in the speech signal is removed through the speech enhancement process and then, subjected to the feature extraction. The features, such as tonal power ratio, Multiple Kernel Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MKMFCC) parameters, and the spectral flux are extracted and provided as the training input to the proposed Taylor-DBN classifier for identifying the emotions present in the signal. The experimentation is done with the help of the Berlin database, real database 1, and the real database 2. The experimental datasets contain the speech signals from different domain and language, and the performance of the proposed Taylor-DBN has shown minimal variations in each domain, and thus, the proposed model is suitable for various domains. The proposed Taylor-DBN outclassed other comparative models with Accuracy, False Acceptance Rate (FAR), and False Rejection Rate (FRR) values of 0.97, 0.0135, and 0.0165, respectively.",

With this change of educational context, it is imperative to know: are students' basic psychological needs being better met and fulfilled? To address this question, this paper adopted a mixed method to discover if, and how, blended learning meets students' three basic psychological needs, specifically relatedness, competence and autonomy. Findings show that the first two need-constructs of relatedness and competence were fulfilled. The need for autonomy, however, was not being met due to school culture, assessment and the perhaps-habitual adherence to the conventional roles of teachers and students. This study also found that the three aforementioned psychological are positively related. In fact, blended learning has provided a new dimension of, and opportunity for, learning interactions for students of differing learning styles. Varieties of academic outputs released other expressions of \"self\" in many students, which enabled the first need for relatedness to be met. Blended learning outputs could bring a positive spiral of development of recognition from others, and meet the second need of competence later, leading to better identity formation, and ultimately again to relatedness.",

Specifically, the authors made the user purchasing behavior as the dependent variable and added some new factors such as perceived risk, individual innovation and product cognition as the independent variables in the model, and they also added user gender and experience as regulated variables, so as to study the impact factors that affect the purchasing behavior. In addition, the authors also studied the impact of social network friend recommendations on consumers' willingness to purchase. Findings The research results showed that effort expectation, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, purchase intention, awareness and individual innovation have a positive effect on the behavior of buying financial products, whereas the perceived risk has a negative effect on the behavior of buying internet financial products. Additionally, in the context of social networking, social network friend recommendations have a positive impact on consumers' willingness to purchase. Practical implications This study can enrich the existing theories on the interpretation of the intention of using internet financial products, help internet financial enterprises understand user behavior and demands better, and improve service quality and customer satisfaction.

In the MPIDRPTW, a set of customers, which have a time-varying demand during a finite planning horizon, is served by a single production facility. The distribution is accomplished by a fleet of homogeneous vehicles that deliver the customer orders within their specific time windows. Production management has to be done according to the inventories at the facility and at the customers. An exact arc flow model based on a graph is proposed to solve the MPIDRPTW, where the nodes represent instants of time. The main goal of the problem is to minimize the costs associated with the entire system. The proposed approach was implemented and a set of experimental tests were conducted based on a set of adapted instances from the literature.",

However, it leads to several research and development challenges regarding robots supervision, control and optimization. This paper presents a simulation and optimization approach for the optimization of robotized treatment tasks using type-c ultraviolet radiation in horticulture. The optimization of tasks scheduling problem is formalized and a heuristic and a genetic algorithms are proposed to solve it. These algorithms are evaluated compared to an exact method using a multi-agent-based simulation approach. The simulator takes into account the evolution of the disease during time and simulates the execution of treatment tasks by the robot.",

In this regard, we introduced a computational framework for ranking a set of banking institutions based on people’s opinion. The introduced framework is based on aspect-based sentiment analysis and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approaches. To evaluate our methodology, we developed a sentiment dataset comprising reviews on four Indian nationalized banks, whose quality is evaluated using 9 aspects/attributes. In order to come up with holistic ranking, we employed simple majority voting on ranking obtained using three multi-criteria decision making methods viz. analytic hierarchy process, VIKOR, and fuzzy multi-attribute decision making. We observed that final ranking obtained using our method has a strong resemblance with real-life outreach of selected four Indian banks.",

Methodologies have been reported in literature for evaluating capability of processes with quantitative characteristics of different natures. However, quantifying capability of a process with qualitative responses remains a difficult task. In this paper, a novel method is presented for measuring capability of a process with ordinal responses involving three ordered categories. The proposed method makes use of the process area of proportions and specification area of proportions defined in a two-dimensional plane. Extensive simulation studies reveal that in general, the defined process area does not always follow a normal distribution. However, by using Johnson transformation, it can be transformed to normal distribution and thus capability of a process with ordinal responses can be evaluated easily. Application of the proposed method to a real life problem is presented.",

By introducing the brake light rules into ChSch model, we proposed a new cellular automaton traffic flow model of intersection considering the effect of brake light and traffic light to avoid running a red light and rear-end collision. The first vehicle of the vehicle queue formed in front of the stop line at red light (FVoQ) is focused, and the evolution characteristics of intersection traffic flow are analyzed. Results show that the proposed model is more realistic than ChSch model in the following aspects: (a) The FVoQ decelerates more smoothly with the proposed model. The behavior of smooth deceleration reflects the driver's desire of comfortable driving in real traffic. (b) The proportion of the FVoQ's great and sudden deceleration to avoid running a red light is greatly reduced with the proposed model. In ChSch model, the proportion is larger than 80%, while in the proposed model, the proportion is less than 1%. The behavior of great and sudden deceleration reflects the aggressive driving pattern of a few drivers in real traffic. (c) The rear-end collision accident rate caused by FVoQ's aggressive driving behaviors is greatly reduced with the proposed model, which conforms more to the real traffic.",

The evaluation of tracking objects, dynamic positions and their visual information in results are quite difficult tasks. Until now, most real-time visual tracking algorithms suffer from poor robustness and low occurrence as they deal with complex real-world data. In this paper, we have proposed more robust and faster visual tracking framework using scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) and the optical flow in belief propagation (BF) algorithm for efficient processing in real scenarios. Here, a new feature-based optical flow along with BF algorithm is utilized to compute the affine matrix of a regional center on SIFT key points in frames. Experimental results depict that the proposed approach is more efficient and more robust in comparison with the state-of-the-art tracking algorithms with more complex scenarios.",

Then we consider the case where all containers have some fixed capacity and give an optimal polynomial-time algorithm for the special case where each type of item has the same size. When the sizes of the item types are nonuniform, we provide a polynomial-time 2-approximation for the problem. We also prove that the approximation ratio of our algorithm is no lower than 1.813.

Item response theory (IRT) models are applied to these tests to estimate the ability of students (as latent variable in the model). In order for quality IRT parameters to be estimated, especially ability parameters, it is important that the appropriate number of dimensions is identified. Through a case study, based on a statistics exam for students in higher education, we show how dimensions and other model parameters can be chosen in a real situation. Our model choice is based both on empirical and on background knowledge of the test. We show that dimensionality influences the estimates of the item-parameters, especially the discrimination parameter which provides information about the quality of the item. We perform a simulation study to generalize our conclusions. Both the simulation study and the case study show that multidimensional models have the advantage to better discriminate between examinees. We conclude from the simulation study that it is safer to use a multidimensional model compared to a unidimensional if it is unknown which model is the correct one.",

Fog computing, an extension of cloud provides computing, networking, storage, communication at the edge of the network, and has overcome the existing challenges of SGs.

Consequently, increasing emphasis has been placed on the importance of randomized clinical trials, which randomize the drugs being tested. This study proposes specific methods for addressing late-onset outcomes for safety and efficacy in phase I/II randomized trials of anticancer drug combinations. Data from patients in cases where the evaluation of safety and efficacy is not complete are considered missing data. A model taking into consideration the missing data mechanism, relationship between safety and efficacy, and correlation between observation points was used to adaptively determine the dose combination to assign to the next cohort. Simulation studies suggested that the proposed method is capable of supporting clinical trials in practice with realistic study periods. We believe the proposed method may flexibly adapt to practical requirements and contribute to advances in drug development.",

Despite a large body of recent lecture capture literature, much of the empirical research adopts positivist paradigms, which overlooks the complex and unpredictable nature of teaching and learning. Addressing this knowledge gap, this exploratory case study adopts sociomaterial approaches, specifically perspectives from the domain of actor-network theory (ANT), to view learning technologies as complex assemblages involving heterogeneous human and non-human entities or actors. This paper explores the entanglements involved in enacting online pedagogy and learning across spatiotemporal dimensions using trace ethnography and visualisation mapping. Examining the student-led study practices revealed that multitasking and fluid task switching, between contrasting networks and spaces, was a significant activity during the playback of lecture recordings. Exploring an innocuous and ubiquitous practice, such as video pausing, affords nuanced perspectives into the sociomaterial entanglements involved in enacting study practices. Moreover, adopting multimodal sensitivities reveals how often overlooked modes, such as iconography, can become actors within an assemblage. This may offer new insights into how modes help produce or stabilise configurations and advance efforts in attending to the non-human within actor-networks.",

Identifying these polyps from endoscopy video or image is a tremendous task to reduce the future risk of gastrointestinal cancer. This paper proposes a proper diagnosis method of polyp using a fusion of contourlet transform and fine-tuned VGG19 pre-trained model from enhanced endoscopic 224 x 224 patch images. This study has used different fine-tuned models (Alexnet, ResNet50, VGG16, VGG19) as well as a few scratch models while fine-tuned VGG19 works better. Also, this research has used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR) dimensionality reduction methods to collect the intuitive features for classification. In Support Vector Machine (SVM) based polyp detection, the prior method (PCA) performs better. Besides, a proposed algorithm marks polyp region from identified polyp patches and uses a binning strategy to process video. A set of experiments are performed on standard public data sets and found comparative improved performance with an accuracy of 99.59%, sensitivity of 99.74% and specificity of 99.44%.

Data analyzed in this study included pre-service teachers N = 107, 1-minute videos and pre- and post surveys. The findings of this qualitative study indicated that student-created video was an active learning activity that contributed to an increase in students' perceived STEM content knowledge, improved perceptions of self-efficacy, and evidence of student engagement inclusive of behavioral, affective, and cognitive domains. Themes derived from the participants' perceptions included: perceived self-efficacy, novelty or usefulness of creating short video, time to design and create video, and content and technical knowledge. Student-created video as an active approach to learning can be included in STEM education to increase STEM knowledge and foster integrative twenty-first Century skills. Practical implications for educators when designing student-created video assignments include (a) following a video development model; (b) providing extra time for content acquisition and revisions; and (c) incorporating peer evaluations.",

There are two types of Quran searching techniques: semantic or concept-based and keyword-based. Concept-based search is a challenging task, especially in a complex corpus such as Quran. This paper presents a concept-based searching tool (QSST) for the Holy Quran. It consists of four phases. In the first phase, the Quran dataset is built by manually annotating Quran verses based on the ontology of Mushaf Al-Tajweed. The second phase is word Embedding, this phase generates features' vectors for words by training a Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) architecture on large Quranic and Classic Arabic corpus. The third phase includes calculating the features' vectors of both input query and Quranic topics. Finally, retrieving the most relevant verses by computing the cosine similarity between both topic and query vectors. The performance of the proposed QSST is measured by comparing results against Mushaf Al-Tajweed. Then, precision, recall, and F-score are computed and their percentages were 76.91%, 72.23% 69.28% respectively. In addition, the results are evaluated by three Islamic experts and the average precision was 91.95%. Finally, QSST results are compared with the recent existing tools; QSST outperformed them.

        "original_csv_abstract": "The demand for electricity increases rapidly along with the advancement of the industrial age. To ensure efficient distribution of the electricity, maintain low losses and high level of quality, and the security of electricity supply, the smart grid concept was proposed. The concept enables a small, individual scale to generate electricity and sell it to the grid. However, the concept adds complexity to the existing system, such as how a transaction between these generators and consumers are conducted, verified and recorded. This paper proposes the blockchain as a tool to manage transactions in the smart grid. Transactions are performed with smart contracts, and the network acts as a transaction verifier. The blockchain provides immutability of the transactions, which ensure every transaction between generators and consumers will always be executed. It also provides immutability to transaction history, which can be used for audit or solving a transaction dispute. (c) 2020 The Authors.

Although, literature is enriched with different power extraction, conversion, and harmonics elimination techniques but still there are problems of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under partial shading conditions, photovoltaic (PV) mismatching, power fluctuation in steady-state condition, and higher total harmonic distortion (THD) value. The article has two manifolds. First, it proposes a fuzzy embedded MPPT controller to extract the maximum available PV power under time-varying environmental conditions. For that, it utilizes seven linguistic variables and fuzzy sets along with 49 rules base to have reduced power fluctuation and power losses in a steady-state condition, and fast tracking under time-varying temperature and solar irradiance condition. The performance of the proposed fuzzy-logic control (FLC)-49 rules base is compared with FLC-25 rules and perturb & observe based MPPT controllers. Second, for fulfilling the load demands with lower switching losses and THD, particle swarm optimization (PSO) based selective harmonic elimination (SHE) technique is applied on a cascaded half-bridge multilevel inverter. SHE technique utilizes switching angles, which are found by solving the nonlinear transcendental equations obtained by Fourier series expansion of stepped output voltage waveform. For that, the proposed research preferred meta-heuristic techniques of PSO over the classical techniques because of their high convergence rate, short run time, less complexity, and ability to obtain lower THD.",

Estimate the population average treatment effect with propensity score adjustment is very popular. From a practical perspective, however, it is not clear whether the post-matching analysis should adjust for the matching structure. Analytical strategies with and without accounting for matching design have appeared in literature. For continuous outcomes, the implication is more on the variance estimation. But for binary outcomes, the non-collapsibility problem for the odds ratio adds another layer of complexity in choosing between estimation strategies. We have conducted extensive simulation studies to compare several matching estimators and the propensity score weighting estimator for both continuous and binary outcomes. Especially, we consider three measures for binary outcomes, risk difference, relative risk and odds ratio. Our simulation results suggest that statistical methods accounting for matching structure are more advantageous and among binary effect measures, odds ratio tends to have higher power than other measures. We also apply different estimation strategies to a U.S. trauma care database to examine mortality difference between trauma centers and non-trauma centers.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the service quality of university library more accurately and dynamically and improve the service efficiency of library. The paper realizes quantified representation of library service quality and overcomes the shortcoming of the traditional library evaluation system, which does not consider reader's identity and cannot be evaluated separately. In addition, according to the function configuration of each department of library, a relation between library evaluation parameter and its organization structure is built. According to the evaluation results and the chain of relations, some suggestions for improving library service can be put forward; thus, it can improve the quality of library service and management efficiency. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, a four-dimensional (4-D) representation method is put forward to express four kinds of parameters, namely, the category of participants, the number of people evaluated, the rating level and the weight of parameters, which is expressed by chromaticity and a three-dimensional column coordinate space. Considering the existing evaluation methods such as LibQUAL+TM, the content of evaluation parameters, the grade of evaluation parameters and the weight of evaluation parameters are modified. Using the volume and the equivalent number of people under this evaluation system, the evaluation grade can be quantified and the total results can be evaluated quantitatively. Findings The evaluation model proposed in this paper is a 4-D system that is based on content parameters to evaluate the number of participants, score segments, evaluation content weights and reader information. It gives full consideration to the good advice of many scholars and combines the actual operation of domestic libraries. The situation effectively integrates successful experience abroad. Both the undergraduate and teacher sampling evaluation results and their analysis in this paper show the accuracy and credibility of the method. Originality/value Although the satisfaction index model has a good effect in foreign countries, taking into account that readers of university libraries in China are different from those in foreign countries in the evaluation methods of the tutorial, professional multi-level evaluation will produce greater errors in practical applications. The traditional four-level method based on Chinese education evaluation (excellent, good, pass and fail) has reached consensus among teachers and students in practical application, and it is easy to achieve consistency. Therefore, this paper also adopts four-level evaluation, that is, very satisfied, satisfied, generally satisfied and very dissatisfied. The embedded application will be able to perform dynamic evaluation and thus can be used in China. The evaluation of service quality in university libraries provides an effective new method.",

It is well known that these estimators have high positive asymptotic breakdown points and are Fisher-consistent as the sample size tends to infinity. To the best of our knowledge, the finite-sample properties of these estimators, depending on the sample size, have not well been studied in the literature. In this paper, we fill this gap by providing their closed-form finite-sample breakdown points and calculating the unbiasing factors and relative efficiencies of the robust estimators through the extensive Monte Carlo simulations up to the sample size 100. The numerical study shows that the unbiasing factor improves the finite-sample performance significantly. In addition, we provide the predicted values for the unbiasing factors obtained by using the least squares method which can be used for the case of sample size more than 100.",

However, there is evidence that the diffusion coefficients under different accelerated stress levels are different in an accelerated degradation test where higher accelerated stress could lead to larger diffusion. Therefore, in contrast to the existing models in which the diffusion coefficients are assumed as a constant or irrelevant to stress levels, this paper allows both the drift coefficients and the diffusion coefficients to be defined as the functions of accelerated stresses. Then, the consequence of model mis-specification in which the proposed model is wrongly fitted by its special case is analyzed based on Kullback-Leibler distance. In addition, the influence of each degradation parameter on the relative bias and the relative variation of the mean time to failure and 100p th percentage of first hitting time is analyzed by simulation methods. Finally, some important differences between the two models are verified by two case studies.",

In this paper, a study on UWA error performance is presented based on t-distribution. Furthermore, the expressions of error performance are derived using binary phase shift keying (BPSK) and quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulations order. Moreover, the new waveform filtered orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (F-OFDM) in UWA with turbo and convolution code is adopted. The simulation results show that at BER 10–3, the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is 6 dB and 11 dB for BPSK and QPSK, respectively. The turbo code performance appears to be superior over the convolution code. Furthermore, the results indicate that F-OFDM significantly improves the power spectral density to approximately 120 dBW compared with OFDM.",

The proposed chart is implemented to monitor the single scale parameter of the Rayleigh distributed process. We have studied the proposed chart under two type of control limits namely probability and -sigma limits. The performance of the proposed chart has been assessed by using power function. In addition, we have investigated run length properties including average run length (ARL), standard deviation of run length (SDRL) and median run length (MDRL). The analysis of run length profile reveals that the proposed V-R chart outperforms the existing charts including the traditional Shewhart control chart and V control charts under Rayleigh distribution. The construction process for the newly proposed chart has been demonstrated using a simulated data. Finally, a real application of the proposed chart, along with the existing chart, is presented that evaluates the strength of glass fiber in a manufacturing process.",

In this paper, we propose a Column Generation (CG) algorithm and a post optimization heuristic based on a Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) to provide both lower and upper bounds for the cost of optimal solutions to VRPMTW. As in CG algorithms for VRP, the master problem is based on a Weighted Set Covering formulation. However, due to the multiple time windows, the pricing subproblem is an Elementary Shortest Path Problem with Multiple Time Windows and Capacity Constraints, which is more difficult to solve than the classical Elementary Shortest Path Problem with a Single Time Window and Capacity Constraints. Computational experiments were performed on 594 instances generated from classical Solomon instances with up to 17 customers. They showed that CG was able to produce lower bounds, within one hour of running time, for 66.7% of the instances. Besides, the post optimization heuristic was able to improve the solution provided by the VNS heuristic in 28.9%, finding integer optimal solutions for 39.9% of the instances. Moreover, for the instances where lower bounds are known, the average optimality gap was 6.0% on average.",

Using matched data from the IT-related executive and chief executive officer of 183 firms, this study finds that IT exploration is positively related to NBMD and EBMD and that IT exploitation is positively related to only EBMD. NBMD and EBMD are significantly related to firm performance. Polynomial regression and response surface analysis reveal that NBMD and EBMD first decline and then rise with the increase in the level of balance between IT exploration and exploitation. NBMD declines but EBMD rises with the increase in the level of imbalance between IT exploration and exploitation.

To study the behavior of Bayes estimates and the effect of masking parameter, simulation study is performed. It is observed that the preference ordering is not disturbed when the number of judges is moderate to large. Also, the preference ordering is observed to be robust with respect to the extent of masking, when the number of judges is large. These findings are also supported by a numerical study using real data.",

To avoid such myths, in this article, we present an important class of applications, where the CAT test performs poorly, and then discuss the type of applications where CAT procedure could be accepted or avoided. However, this does not mean that it is not possible to develop improved tests by taking the CAT approach, as we show in this article by employing the LRT statistic instead of ML/REML-based CAT tests, as authors of the original CAT article also now advocate. In fact, in terms of the Type I error, LRT-based CAT test performed well among tests we studied, except when k, the number of groups in one-way layout is small, in which case the generalized p-value-based tests can be employed. We believe this note will encourage further research to take full benefits of the CAT approach, in such problems as higher way ANOVA and mixed-effects regression models, for which generalized tests are currently available.",

Presently, student interest is primarily assessed by administering questionnaires or conducting case analyses. However, this method cannot provide timely feedback in the learning environment to allow an instructor to make immediate improvements for a more effective learning process. Hence, we designed an intelligent analysis method to analyse student interest using multimodal natural sensing technology. In this study, we present a three-dimensional (3D) learning interest model designed from an educational psychology perspective which comprehensively describes student interest in a learning environment: cognitive attention, learning emotion and thinking activity. Multimodal data are compiled by head pose estimation, facial expression recognition and interactive data collection and interpreted based on this model. Then, multimodal data fusion is conducted to comprehensively gauge student interest. Experimental testing revealed that the proposed 3D model of learning interest could objectively reflect student interest, providing an effective basis for improving teaching in real time.",

This takes into account the idea of concordance or association between the two variables. They have made use of extensive illustrations including a series of confidence intervals to show the applicability and interpretation of their proposed measure. In this work, we propose an alternative measure for positive correlation between integrated time series processes. We support this idea through …",
