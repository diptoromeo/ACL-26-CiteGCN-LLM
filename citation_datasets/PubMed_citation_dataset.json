There are particular advantages for older individuals in terms of elective surgery, timely transplantation, and early graft function. Yet, despite the superiority of living donor transplantation especially for this cohort, older patients are significantly less likely to access this treatment modality than younger age groups. However, given the changing population demographic in recent decades, there are increasing numbers of older but otherwise healthy individuals with kidney disease who could benefit from living donor transplantation. The complex reasons for this inequity of access are explored, including conscious and unconscious age-related bias by healthcare professionals, concerns relating to older living donors, ethical anxieties related to younger adults donating to aging patients, unwillingness of potential older recipients to consider living donation, and the relevant legislation. There is a legal and moral duty to consider the inequity of access to living donor transplantation, recognising both the potential disparity between chronological and physiological age in older patients, and benefits of this treatment for individuals as well as society.",

In this study, intravitreal injection of BIBF1120 blocked the phosphorylation of VEGFR2, FGFR1, PDGFR<i>&#946;</i>, and MAPK signaling pathway proteins in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic retinopathy mouse model. In <i>in vitro</i> cell experiments, BIBF1120 did not change cellular activity under normal conditions, while it further suppressed the tube formation, migration, and proliferation of high glucose-induced human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs). Additionally, BIBF1120 blocked the phosphorylation of p38, JNK, and ERK1/2 in high glucose-treating HRMECs. Our results indicate that the BIBF1120 treatment can be a novel potential drug to protect against DR.",

Copper induces an excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in hair cells, leading to the development of various antioxidants. <b>Methods and results:</b> This study aimed to evaluate the potential antioxidant properties of curcumin (CUR) in the inner ear organ of corti-1 cells (OC1) and animal models (zebrafish and guinea pigs). Graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs) enabled CUR to penetrate the round window membrane (RWM) and maintain the concentration in the perilymph after inner ear administration. The results showed that CUR/GOQDs had favorable biocompatibility and strongly affected ROS generation induced by CIS in OC1 cells. DCFHDA Green staining demonstrated that CUR/GOQDs successfully reversed the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential induced by CIS <i>in vitro</i> and rescued cells from early cuproptosis, which was confirmed by FDX1 staining. Additionally, the experiment found that CUR decreased the expression of cuproptosis proteins (FDX1, LIAS, and LIPT1) and increased the expression of the Bcl-2 protein. <b>Conclusion:</b> The results demonstrate that CUR/GOQDs is a promising therapeutic agent that can prevent CIS-induced ototoxicity by blocking the cuproptosis signal pathway.",

      "original_csv_abstract": "Replacing traditional substrates in industrial bioprocesses to advance the sustainable production of chemicals is an urgent need in the context of the circular economy. However, since the limited degradability of non-conventional carbon sources often returns lower yields, effective exploitation of such substrates requires a multi-layer optimization which includes not only the provision of a suitable feedstock but the use of highly robust and metabolically versatile microbial biocatalysts. We tackled this challenge by means of systems metabolic engineering and validated <i>Escherichia coli</i> W as a promising cell factory for the production of the key building block chemical 2-ketoisovalerate (2-KIV) using whey as carbon source, a widely available and low-cost agro-industrial waste. First, we assessed the growth performance of <i>Escherichia coli</i> W on mono and disaccharides and demonstrated that using whey as carbon source enhances it significantly. Second, we searched the available literature and used metabolic modeling approaches to scrutinize the metabolic space of <i>E. coli</i> and explore its potential for overproduction of 2-KIV identifying as basic strategies the block of pyruvate depletion and the modulation of NAD/NADP ratio. We then used our model predictions to construct a suitable microbial chassis capable of overproducing 2-KIV with minimal genetic perturbations, i.e., deleting the pyruvate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase. Finally, we used modular cloning to construct a synthetic 2-KIV pathway that was not sensitive to negative feedback, which effectively resulted in a rerouting of pyruvate towards 2-KIV. The resulting strain shows titers of up to 3.22 &#177; 0.07&#160;g/L of 2-KIV and 1.40 &#177; 0.04&#160;g/L of L-valine in 24&#160;h using whey in batch cultures. Additionally, we obtained yields of up to 0.81&#160;g 2-KIV/g substrate. The optimal microbial chassis we present here has minimal genetic modifications and is free of nutritional autotrophies to deliver high 2-KIV production rates using whey as a non-conventional substrate.",

Owing to adaptability and climate change, these mosquito vectors are predicted to establish in new geographical areas thus exposing larger populations to the risk of infection. Therefore, control of <i>Aedes</i> vector is necessary to prevent disease transmission. Recently, genetic approaches to vector control have shown promise; however, the tools and methods for manipulating the mosquito genome are rather limited. While CRISPR-Cas9 system has been adapted for gene editing purposes in <i>Aedes</i> mosquito, the dCas9-based transcription control of genes remain unexplored. In this study we report implementation of the CRISPR activation system in <i>Aedes</i> cells. For this we designed, constructed and tested a bi-partite plasmid-based strategy that allows expression of the dCas9-VPR and targeting guide RNA together with a reporter cassette. Quantitative analysis of the fluorescent reporter gene levels showed a robust over-expression validating CRISPR activation in <i>Aedes</i> cells. This strategy and the biological parts will be useful resource for synthetic transcription factor-based robust upregulation of <i>Aedes</i> genes for application of synthetic biology approaches for vector control.",

Compared with conventional photosensitizers, carbon dots (CDs) have great potential. Therefore, developing a water-soluble, low-toxicity photosensitizer based on CDs is particularly important, especially one that can enhance the photodynamic efficacy using the tumor microenvironment to produce oxygen. Herein, manganese-doped carbon dot (Mn-CDs, &#8764;2.7&#160;nm) nanoenzymes with excellent biocompatibility were prepared by a solvothermal method using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid manganese disodium salt hydrate and o-phenylenediamine as precursors. TEM, AFM, HR-TEM, XRD, XPS, FT-IR, &#950; potential, DLS, UV-Vis, and PL spectra were used to characterize the Mn-CDs. Cancer resistance was assessed using the CCK-8 kit, calcein AM versus propidium iodide (PI) kit, and the Annexin V-FITC/PI cell apoptosis assay kit. The obtained Mn-CDs have excellent near-infrared emission properties, stability, and efficient <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> generation. Notably, the manganese doping renders CDs with catalase (CAT)-like activity, which leads to the decomposition of acidic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> <i>in situ</i> to generate O<sub>2</sub>, enhancing the PDT efficacy against OSCC-9 cells under 635&#160;nm (300&#160;mW&#183;cm<sup>-2</sup>) irradiation. Thus, this work provides a simple and feasible method for the development of water-soluble photosensitizers with oxygen production, presenting good biosafety for PDT in hypoxic tumors.",

The treatments available today are either ineffective or have adverse effects. The dysregulation of B cell activation is crucial for the emergence of SLE. MiR-7 explicitly targeted PTEN mRNA in B cells. Treatment with antagomiR-7 reduced B cell hyperresponsiveness and prevented the onset of lupus. As a result, inhibiting miR-7 may be used therapeutically to treat SLE. We developed a SA (sialic acid)-poly (D, L-lactide-co-glycolide) (SA-PLGA) nano delivery system to deliver antagomiR-7 into splenic B cells since the stability and targeted delivery of miRNA remain significant challenges <i>in vivo</i>. Results show that SA-PLGA nanoparticles (SA-PLGA@antagomiR-7) loaded with antagomiR-7 display good biocompatibility and shield antagomiR-7 from degradation, extending the miRNA's duration in circulation <i>in vivo</i>. Additionally, in MRL/Ipr lupus mice, SA-PLGA@antagomiR-7 is successfully delivered to the splenic B cells and preferentially enriched in the diseased spleen in MRL/Ipr lupus mice. The SA-PLGA@antagomiR-7 NPs therapy effectively decreases immunological abnormalities, normalizes splenic B cell subtypes, and suppresses B cell activation. The antagomiR-7 NPs exhibit excellent therapeutic efficiency and high biosafety collectively, which may result in a more effective treatment for SLE.",

Condensed tannins were extracted from industrial bark of Norway spruce by using pressurized hot water extraction (PHWE), followed by purification of extracts by using XADHP7 treatment to obtain sugar-free extract. The chemical composition of the extracts was analyzed by using HPLC, GC&#8210;MS and UHPLC after thiolytic degradation. The test matrices, i.e., lignocellulosic handsheets, were produced and impregnated with tannin-rich extracts, and tannic acid was used as a commercial reference. The antibacterial and antiviral efficacy of the handsheets were analyzed by using bioluminescent bacterial strains (<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> RN4220+pAT19 and <i>Escherichia coli</i> K12+pCGLS11) and Enterovirus coxsackievirus B3. Potential bonding of the tannin-rich extract and tannic acid within the fiber matrices was studied by using FTIR-ATR spectroscopy. The deposition characteristics (distribution and accumulation patterns) of tannin compounds and extracts within fiber networks were measured and visualized by direct chemical mapping using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and digital microscopy. Our results demonstrated for the first time, how tannin-rich extracts obtained from spruce bark side streams with green chemistry possess antiviral and antibacterial properties when immobilized into fiber matrices to create substitutes for plastic hygienic products, personal protection materials such as surgical face masks, or food packaging materials to prolong the shelf life of foodstuffs and prevent the spread of infections. However, more research is needed to further develop this proof-of-concept to ensure stable chemical bonding in product prototypes with specific chemistry.",

In an attempt to overcome some obstacles with cellulose II cell scaffolding materials related to insufficient biomineralization, lack of micron-size porosity, and deficiency in surface charge, respective solutions have been proposed. These included covalent phosphorylation of different cellulose materials targeting relatively low degrees of substitution (DS 0.18-0.23) and processing these cellulose derivatives into scaffolding materials by a dissolution/coagulation approach employing the hitherto rarely used TBAF/DMSO/H<sub>2</sub>O system for cellulose dissolution. Here, we report bioactivity and preliminary hemocompatibility testing of dual-porous cellulose phosphate aerogels (contrasted with the phosphate-free reference) obtained via coagulation (water/ethanol), solvent exchange and scCO<sub>2</sub> drying. Deposition of hydroxyapatite from simulated body fluid (7 days of immersion) revealed good bioactivity (1.5-2.2&#160;mg Ca<sup>2+</sup> per mg scaffold). Incubation of the scCO<sub>2</sub>-dried and rehydrated scaffolding materials in heparin anticoagulated human whole blood was conducted to study selected parameters of hemostasis (prothrombin F1+2 fragment, PF4, count of thrombocyte-leukocyte conjugates) and inflammatory response (C5a fragment, leukocyte activation marker CD11b). Adhesion of leukocytes on the surface of the incubated substrates was assessed by scanning electron and fluorescence microscopy (DAPI staining). The results suggest that phosphorylation at low DS does not increase platelet activation. However, a significant increase in platelet activation and thrombin formation was observed after a certain fraction of the negative surface charges had been compensated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions. The combination of both phosphorylation and calcification turned out to be a potent means for controlling the inflammatory response, which was close to baseline level for some of the studied samples.",

Near-infrared-II (900-1700&#160;nm, NIR-II) fluorescence microscopic imaging (NIR-II-FMI) has shown great potential for biomedical detection. A novel type of negative target imaging method based on NIR-II-FMI with the assistance of indocyanine green (ICG) was explored.

The negative targeting NIR-II fluorescence imaging of HAE-infected mice at different stages with the assistance of ICG under 808&#160;nm of laser irradiation was obtained. Especially, HAE microlesions at the early stage were detected clearly. Moreover, clear intrahepatic angiography was achieved under the same NIR-II-FMI system.",

Allograft spacer is mainly used in cervical fusion, especially in the anterior approach. The synthetic bone graft material BGS-7(CaO-SiO2-P2O5-B2O3, bioactive Glass-Ceramics) can bind with surrounding bone tissue by forming a hydroxyapatite layer bone bridge, leading to faster graft osseointegration. This study was conducted to compare long-term clinical outcome of BGS-7 spacer and allograft spacer for anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> From September 2014 to December 2016, Consecutive anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgeries using a BGS-7 spacer (N = 18) and Allograft spacer (N = 26) were compared for postoperative clinical outcomes. Radiologic assessments were performed, and Instrumental failure, including breakage, cage migration, subsidence were observed and Fusion status were analyzed. Finite element analysis was performed for simulating mechanical stress between the vertebral body and implant. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using neck VAS, NDI, and JOA on the patient's final follow-up visits. <b>Results:</b> Among the 44 patients who underwent an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery using the BGS-7 spacer and Allograft spacer, there were 30 men and 14 women. The average age at the operation was 47.69 &#177; 10.49 in allograft spacer and 51.67 &#177; 11.03 in BGS-7 spacer. The mean follow-up period was 89.18 &#177; 5.44&#160;months. Twenty three (88.46%) patients in allograft spacer and 20(100%) patients in BGS-7 spacer were demonstrated radiologic evidence of interbody fusion in last OPD, which accounts for fusion grade 4 or 5. Peak stresses were 343.85&#160;MPa in allograft spacer, and 132.55&#160;MPa in BGS-7 spacer. Long-term clinical outcomes including neck VAS, NDI, and JOA didn't show statistical differences between the two groups. There were no adverse events related to the BGS-7 spacer.10.3389/fbioe.2023.110046. <b>Conclusion:</b> The BGS-7 spacer demonstrated reliability as a spacer in anterior cervical discectomy and fusionF surgery without instrumental failure. Early stabilization with a bony bridge formation was observed at the intermediate follow-up period, and the long-term clinical outcome was favorable at more than 60&#160;months after surgery without any adverse events. Thus, the BGS-7 spacer is a safe and effective alternative to the allograft spacer in anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery.",

Studies of cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and cell-cell interactions can help scientists understand the mysteries of living systems. However, there is considerable heterogeneity among cells. Great differences between individuals can be found even within the same cell cluster. Cell heterogeneity can only be clearly expressed and distinguished at the level of single cells. The development of droplet microfluidics technology opens up a new chapter for single-cell analysis. Microfluidic chips can produce many nanoscale monodisperse droplets, which can be used as small isolated micro-laboratories for various high-throughput, precise single-cell analyses. Moreover, gel droplets with good biocompatibility can be used in single-cell cultures and coupled with biomolecules for various downstream analyses of cellular metabolites. The droplets are also maneuverable; through physical and chemical forces, droplets can be divided, fused, and sorted to realize single-cell screening and other related studies. This review describes the channel design, droplet generation, and control technology of droplet microfluidics and gives a detailed overview of the application of droplet microfluidics in single-cell culture, single-cell screening, single-cell detection, and other aspects. Moreover, we provide a recent review of the application of droplet microfluidics in tumor single-cell immunoassays, describe in detail the advantages of microfluidics in tumor research, and predict the development of droplet microfluidics at the single-cell level.",

Their unique nanostructure attributes it a special role in medical applications. However, bibliometric studies have not been conducted in this field. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to conduct a bibliometric analysis to evaluate the global scientific output of MXene in biomedical research, explore the current situation of this field in the past years and predicte its research hotpots. <b>Methods:</b> We utilized visual analysis softwares Citespace and Bibliometrix to analyze all relevant documents published in the period of 2011-2022. The bibliometric records were obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection. <b>Results:</b> A total of 1,489 publications were analyzed in this study. We observed that China is the country with the largest number of publications, with Sichuan University being the institution with the highest number of publications in this field. The most publications on MXene medicine research in the past year were found primarily in journals about Chemistry/Materials/Physics. Moreover, ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces was found to be the most productive journal in this field. Co-cited references and keyword cluster analysis revealed that #antibacterial# and #photothermal therapy# are the research focus keyword and burst detection suggested that driven wearable electronics were newly-emergent research hot spots. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our bibliometric analysis indicates that research on MXene medical application remains an active field of study. At present, the research focus is on the application of MXene in the field of antibacterial taking advantage of its photothermal properties. In the future, wearable electronics is the research direction of MXene medical application.",

The current study focuses on zinc oxide nanoparticles' (ZnO NPs) simple production, characterization, and applications in several fields, including medicinal and photocatalytic degradation of dyes. The non-aqueous-based reflux method is helpful for ZnO NP synthesis; the procedure involves refluxing zinc acetate dihydrate precursor in ethylene glycol for 3 hours in the absence of sodium acetate, in which the refluxing rate and the cooling rate are optimized to get the desired phase, and the unique morphology of polyol-mediated ZnO NPs; it has been achieved using the capping agent TBAB (tetra-butyl ammonium bromide) and precursor zinc acetate dihydrate. UV-Vis, FTIR, XRD, and FESEM structurally characterized polyol-mediated ZnO-NPs. The results show that the material is pure and broadly aggregated into spherical nanoparticles with an average particle size of 18.09 nm. According to XRD analysis, heat annealing made the crystallites more prominent and favored a monocrystalline state. These results and the low cost of making polyol-mediated ZnO NPs demonstrate photocatalytic and antimicrobial properties.",

However, for preclinical trials and toxicity investigations in animal models, more comprehensive datasets are typically needed to determine discriminative features between experimental treatments, which oftentimes require analysis of multiple images and their associated differential quantification using manual segmentation methods. Furthermore, for manual segmentation of image data, three or more readers is the gold standard of analysis, but this requirement can be time-consuming and inefficient, depending on variability due to reader bias. In previous papers, microCT image manual segmentation was a valuable tool for assessment of lung pathology in several animal models; however, the manual segmentation approach and the commercial software used was typically a major rate-limiting step. To improve the efficiency, the semi-manual segmentation method was streamlined, and a semi-automated segmentation process was developed to produce:\u2022Quantifiable segmentations: using manual and semi-automated analysis methods for assessing experimental injury and toxicity models,\u2022Deterministic results and efficiency through automation in an unbiased and parameter free process, thereby reducing reader variance, user time, and increases throughput in data analysis,\u2022Cost-Effectiveness: portable with low computational resource demand, based on a cross-platform open-source ImageJ program.",

Comprehensive analysis of the results of clinical, epidemiological, immunological and molecular studies justified that endogenous estrogens are the principal regulators of embryonic development, survival and reproduction <i>via</i> orchestrating appropriate expression and even edition of all genes in mammalians. Medical use of chemically modified synthetic estrogens caused toxic complications; thromboembolic events and increased cancer risk in female organs as they proved to be endocrine disruptors deregulating estrogen receptors (ERs) rather than their activators. Synthetic estrogen treatment exhibits ambiguous correlations with cancer risk at different sites, which may be attributed to an inhibition of the unliganded activation of estrogen receptors (ERs) coupled with compensatory liganded activation. The principle of estrogen induced breast cancer led to the introduction of antiestrogen therapies against this tumor; inhibition of the liganded activation of estrogen receptors and aromatase enzyme activity. The initial enthusiasm turned into disappointment as the majority of breast cancers proved to be primarily resistant to antiestrogens. In addition, nearly all patients showing earlier good tumor responses to endocrine therapy, later experienced secondary resistance leading to metastatic disease and fatal outcome. Studying the molecular events in tumors responsive and unresponsive to antiestrogen therapy, it was illuminated that a complete inhibition of liganded ER activation stimulates the growth of cancers, while a successful compensatory upregulation of estrogen signal may achieve DNA restoration, tumor regression and patient's survival. Recognition of the principal role of endogenous estrogens in gene expression, gene edition and DNA repair, estrogen treatment and stimulation of ER expression in patients may bring about a great turn in medical practice.",

The first committed step for chlorophyll biosynthesis is insertion of magnesium into protoporphyrin IX by magnesium chelatase. Magnesium chelatase is composed of H-, I-, and D-subunits, with the tetrapyrrole substrate binding to the H-subunit. This subunit is rapidly inactivated in the presence of substrate, light, and oxygen, so oxygenic photosynthetic organisms require mechanisms to protect magnesium chelatase from similar loss of function. An additional protein, GUN4, binds to the H-subunit and to tetrapyrroles. GUN4 has been proposed to serve this protective role via its ability to bind linear tetrapyrroles (bilins). In the current work, we probe the origins of bilin binding by GUN4 via comparative phylogenetic analysis and biochemical validation of a conserved bilin-binding motif. Based on our results, we propose that bilin-binding GUN4 proteins arose early in cyanobacterial evolution and that this early acquisition represents an ancient adaptation for maintaining chlorophyll biosynthesis in the presence of light and oxygen.",

Here, we describe a tadpole optic nerve crush (ONC) procedure and assessments of brain reinnervation based on live imaging of RGC-specific transgenes which, when paired with CRISPR/Cas9 injections at the one-cell stage, can be used to assess the function of regeneration-associated genes in vivo in F0 animals. Using this assay, we find that map3k12, also known as dual leucine zipper kinase (Dlk), is necessary for RGC axonal regeneration and acts in a dose-dependent manner. Loss of Dlk does not affect RGC innervation of the brain during development or visually driven behavior but does block both axonal regeneration and functional vision restoration after ONC. Dlk loss does not alter the acute changes in mitochondrial movement that occur within RGC axons hours after ONC but does completely block the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor Jun within RGCs days after ONC; yet, Jun is dispensable for reinnervation. These results demonstrate that in a species fully capable of regenerating its RGC axons, Dlk is essential for the axonal injury signal to reach the nucleus but may affect regeneration through a different pathway than by which it signals in mammalian RGCs.",

In most cases, the identification of TAG has been based on the detection of the spot showing the mobility similar to the TAG standard in thin-layer chromatography (TLC) of neutral lipids. In this study, we identified monoacyl plastoquinol (acyl PQH) as the predominant molecular species in the TAG-like spot from the unicellular <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 (<i>S</i>.6803) as well as the filamentous <i>Nostocales</i> sp., <i>Nostoc punctiforme</i> PCC 73102, and <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120. In <i>S</i>.6803, the accumulation level of acyl PQH but not TAG was affected by deletion or overexpression of <i>slr2103</i>, indicating that acyl PQH is the physiological product of Slr2103 having homology with the eukaryotic diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2 (DGAT2). Electron microscopy revealed that cyanobacterial strains used in this study do not accumulate lipid droplet structures such as those observed in oleaginous microorganisms. Instead, they accumulate polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) granules and/or aggregates of alkane, free C16 and C18 saturated fatty acids, and low amounts of TAG in the cytoplasmic area, which can be detected by staining with a fluorescent dye specific to neutral lipids. Unlike these lipophilic materials, acyl PQH is exclusively localized in the membrane fraction. There must be DGAT2-like enzymatic activity esterifying de novo-synthesized C16 and C18 fatty acids to PQH<sub>2</sub> in the thylakoid membranes.",

The activation of Aitken-mode particles increases the CCN budget of Arctic low-level clouds and, accordingly, affects Arctic climate forcing. However, the growth mechanism of Aitken-mode particles from NPF into CCN range in the summertime Arctic boundary layer remains a subject of current research. In this combined Arctic cruise field and modeling study, we investigated Aitken-mode particle growth to sizes above 80&#8197;nm. A mechanism is suggested that explains how Aitken-mode particles can become CCN without requiring high water vapor supersaturation. Model simulations suggest the formation of semivolatile compounds, such as methanesulfonic acid (MSA) in fog droplets. When the fog droplets evaporate, these compounds repartition from CCNs into the gas phase and into the condensed phase of nonactivated Aitken-mode particles. For MSA, a mass increase factor of 18 is modeled. The postfog redistribution mechanism of semivolatile acidic and basic compounds could explain the observed growth of &gt;20&#8197;nm h<sup>-1</sup> for 60-nm particles to sizes above 100&#8197;nm. Overall, this study implies that the increasing frequency of NPF and fog-related particle processing can affect Arctic cloud properties in the summertime boundary layer.",

In response to vaccine shortages, several countries implemented dose-sparing vaccination strategies, stretching a full-dose vaccine vial into up to five fractional-dose vaccines. Recent studies have found mixed results regarding the effectiveness of the mpox vaccine, raising the question of the utility of dose-sparing strategies. We used an age- and risk-stratified mathematical model of an urban MSM population in the United States with \u223c12% high-risk MSM to evaluate potential benefits from implementing dose-sparing vaccination strategies in which a full dose is divided into 3.5 fractional doses. We found that results strongly depend on the fractional-dose vaccine effectiveness (VE) and vaccine supply. With very limited vaccines available, enough to protect with a full dose approximately one-third of the high-risk population, dose-sparing strategies are more beneficial provided that fractional doses preserved at least 40% of full-dose effectiveness (34% absolute VE), projecting 13% (34% VE) to 70% (68% absolute VE) fewer infections than full-dose strategies. In contrast, if vaccine supply is enough to cover the majority of the high-risk population, dose-sparing strategies can be outperformed by full-dose strategies. Scenarios in which fractional dosing was 34% efficacious resulted in almost three times more infections than full dosing. Our analysis suggests that when mpox vaccine supply is limited and fractional-dose vaccination retains moderate effectiveness, there are meaningful health benefits from providing a smaller dose to a larger number of people in the high-risk population. These findings should inform the public-health response to future mpox outbreaks.",

Nonetheless, only a small fraction of patients respond to immunotherapy, and the costs and side effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors cannot be ignored. With the advent of machine and deep learning, clinical and genetic data have been used to stratify patient responses to immunotherapy. Unfortunately, these approaches have typically been \"black-box\" methods that are unable to explain their predictions, thereby hindering their responsible clinical application. Herein, we developed a \"white-box\" Bayesian network model that achieves accurate and interpretable predictions of immunotherapy responses against nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This tree-augmented na\u00efve Bayes (TAN) model accurately predicted durable clinical benefits and distinguished two clinically significant subgroups with distinct prognoses. Furthermore, our state-of-the-art white-box TAN approach achieved greater accuracy than previous methods. We hope that our model will guide clinicians in selecting NSCLC patients who truly require immunotherapy and expect our approach to be easily applied to other types of cancer.",

A canonical self-avoidance model seems to provide a central mechanistic basis for Dscam1 functions in neuronal wiring. Here, we reveal extensive noncanonical functions of Dscam1 isoforms in neuronal wiring. We generated a series of allelic <i>cis</i> mutations in <i>Dscam1</i>, encoding a normal number of isoforms, but with an altered isoform composition. Despite normal dendritic self-avoidance and self-/nonself-discrimination in dendritic arborization (da) neurons, which is consistent with the canonical self-avoidance model, these mutants exhibited strikingly distinct spectra of phenotypic defects in the three types of neurons: up to &#8764;60% defects in mushroom bodies, a significant increase in branching and growth in da neurons, and mild axonal branching defects in mechanosensory neurons. Remarkably, the altered isoform composition resulted in increased dendrite growth yet inhibited axon growth. Moreover, reducing Dscam1 dosage exacerbated axonal defects in mushroom bodies and mechanosensory neurons but reverted dendritic branching and growth defects in da neurons. This splicing-tuned regulation strategy suggests that axon and dendrite growth in diverse neurons cell-autonomously require Dscam1 isoform composition. These findings provide important insights into the functions of Dscam1 isoforms in neuronal wiring.",

The need for improving the filtering efficiency performance to prevent penetration of fine particulate matter (PM), which can be potential bacteria or virus carriers, has led the research into developing new methods and techniques for face mask fabrication. In this perspective, Electrospinning has shown to be the most efficient technique to get either synthetic or natural polymers-based fibers with size down to the nanoscale providing remarkable performance in terms of both particle filtration and breathability. The aim of this Review is to give further insight into the implementation of electrospun nanofibers for the realization of the next generation of face masks, with functionalized membranes via addiction of active material to the polymer solutions that can give optimal features about antibacterial, antiviral, self-sterilization, and electrical energy storage capabilities. Furthermore, the recent advances regarding the use of renewable materials and green solvent strategies to improve the sustainability of electrospun membranes and to fabricate eco-friendly filters are here discussed, especially in view of the large-scale nanofiber production where traditional membrane manufacturing may result in a high environmental and health risk.",

However, equine metabolic syndrome has only been recognized in recent decades. Functioning energy metabolism is pivotal to normal body homeostasis and affects essentially all organ systems, including reproduction. Previous literature suggests that obesity has an effect not only on the reproductive processes in mares but also on offspring health, predisposing the offspring to later-onset orthopedic and metabolic problems. This review focuses on the effects of obesity, insulin dysregulation and hyperinsulinemia on the reproductive functions of mares and the implications on foal health before and after birth. The points of interest are the cyclicity and ovarian function, uterine environment, gestation, the postpartum period, and the newborn foal. The aim is to review the current state of knowledge, and identify outstanding questions that could stimulate future research. This topic is important not only from the equine industry and production perspective but is also relevant for the welfare of future populations and individuals.",

      "original_csv_abstract": "Disease conditions that involve multiple predisposing or contributing factors, or manifest as low performance and/or low-level mortality, can pose a diagnostic challenge that requires an interdisciplinary approach. Reaching a diagnosis may also be limited by a lack of available clinical profile parameter reference ranges to discriminate healthy fish from those affected by specific disease conditions. Here, we describe our experience investigating poorly performing rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) in an intensive recirculation aquaculture, where reaching a final diagnosis of nephrocalcinosis was not as straightforward as one would wish. To list the issues making the diagnosis difficult, it was necessary to consider the creeping onset of the problem. Further diagnostic steps needed to ensure success included obtaining comparative data for fish blood profiles and water quality from both test and control aquacultural systems, excluding infections with salmonid pathogenic agents and evaluating necropsy findings. Major events in the pathophysiology of nephrocalcinosis could be reconstructed as follows: aquatic environment hyperoxia and hypercapnia &#8594; blood hypercapnia &#8594; blood acid-base perturbation (respiratory acidosis) &#8594; metabolic compensation (blood bicarbonate elevation and kidney phosphate excretion) &#8594; a rise in blood pH &#8594; calcium phosphate precipitation and deposition in tissues. This case highlights the need to consider the interplay between water quality and fish health when diagnosing fish diseases and reaching causal diagnoses.",

      "original_csv_abstract": "Both condensed and hydrolysable tannins (CTs and HTs, respectively) have the ability to reduce enteric CH<sub>4</sub> production in ruminants. However, the precise mechanism of action is not fully understood. Among the proposed hypotheses are the reduction of ruminal digestibility, direct control action on protozoa, reduction of archaea, and a hydrogen sink mechanism. In this <i>in vitro</i> study, which simulated rumen fermentation, two additives, one containing CTs (70% based on DM) from quebracho and one with HTs (75% based on DM) from chestnut, at four levels of inclusion (2, 4, 6, 8% on an as-fed basis) were added to the fermentation substrate and tested against a negative control. Both types of tannins significantly reduced total gas (GP) and CH<sub>4</sub> (ml/g DM) production during the 48&#8201;h of incubation. The lower GP and CH<sub>4</sub> production levels were linked to the reduction in dry matter digestibility caused by CTs and HTs. Conversely, no significant differences were observed for the protozoan and archaeal populations, suggesting a low direct effect of tannins on these rumen microorganisms <i>in vitro</i>. However, both types of tannins had negative correlations for the families Bacteroidales_BS11 and F082 and positive correlations for the genera <i>Prevotella</i> and <i>Succinivibrio</i>. Regarding the fermentation parameters, no differences were observed for pH and total volatile fatty acid production, while both CTs and HTs linearly reduced the NH<sub>3</sub> content. CTs from quebracho were more effective in reducing CH<sub>4</sub> production than HTs from chestnut. However, for both types of tannins, the reduction in CH<sub>4</sub> production was always associated with a lower digestibility without any changes in archaea or protozoa. Due to the high variability of tannins, further studies investigating the chemical structure of the compounds and their mechanisms of action are needed to understand the different results reported in the literature.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the importance of differentiating between low viable (secondary crushing losses) and viable crushed (primary crushing losses) piglets for the evaluation of risk factors for crushing related to characteristics of the sow, the litter, and the environment. Eleven Swiss farmers recorded sows' production data (parity class, gestation length, numbers of live-born and stillborn piglets), data (age, sex, weight, cause of death, and signs of weakness) for every live-born piglet that died in the first week after birth (piglet loss), and ambient temperature. Piglet losses were assigned to five categorical events: <i>piglet loss</i>, subdivided into <i>not crushed</i> and <i>crushed</i>, the latter being further subdivided into <i>low viable crushed</i> and <i>viable crushed</i>. Piglets recorded by the farmer as <i>crushed</i> were assigned to the events <i>low viable crushed</i> and <i>viable crushed</i> based on the piglet's body weight and signs of weakness (diseases, malformations). Data of 9,543 live-born piglets from 740 litters were eventually used to statistically model the hazard of dying at any given time in the first week after birth due to one of these events (mixed-effects Cox model). Five potential risk factors were analyzed as co-variates: parity class, gestation length, number of live-born piglets, number of stillborn piglets, and daily number of hours with ambient temperature &gt;30&#176;C. We identified two risk factors for dying from the event <i>viable crushed</i> that were not identified as risk factors for <i>low viable crushed</i>, namely shorter gestation length and higher daily number of hours with ambient temperature&#8201; &gt;&#8201;30&#176;C. <i>Vice-versa</i>, we identified additional live-born piglets in the litter as risk factor for <i>low viable crushed</i>, but not for <i>viable crushed</i>. Our results show the importance of differentiating between low viable and viable crushed piglets for the interpretation of risk factors for crushing losses. Therefore, we suggest that for breeding purposes and in research, this differentiation should be made.",

      "original_csv_abstract": "Hip dysplasia (HD) is a common orthopedic problem in young dogs. To decrease the laxity of the hip joint related to HD, the surgical treatments are recommended to increase femoral head coverage. ACEtabular rim eXtension (ACE-X) using a personalized 3-dimensional printed titanium shelf implant is a new surgical treatment to increase femoral head coverage and decrease laxity of the dysplastic hip joint, however, the efficacy is less know. Client-owned dogs older than 6 months with clinical signs of coxofemoral joint subluxation and radiographic evidence of HD with no or mild osteoarthritis (OA) were included. The Norberg angle (NA), linear percentage of femoral head overlap (LFO), and percentage of femoral head coverage (PC) were investigated radiographically and with computed tomography (CT) before and after surgery. OA was graded (scores 0-3) according to the maximum osteophyte size measured on CT. In addition, joint laxity (Ortolani) test results, gait analysis, and the Helsinki chronic pain index (HCPI) questionnaire were obtained at preoperative, immediately postoperative and at 1.5- and 3-month evaluations. Acetabular rim extension was performed in 61 hips of 34 dogs; NA, LFO, and PC were significantly higher immediately postoperatively and at the 1.5- and 3-month follow-up examinations compared with preoperative values (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Osteophyte size gradually increased over time (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The OA score significantly increased between preoperatively and directly postoperatively, and between preoperatively and at 3-month follow-up (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The laxity test normalized in 59 out of 61 hips after surgery, and the HCPI questionnaire showed that the pain score decreased significantly at 1.5 and 3 months, postoperatively. The force plate showed no significant improvement during the 3 months follow-up. Although pain reduction by the implant was unclear in short-term results, a personalized shelf implant significantly increased femoral head coverage and eliminated subluxation of the dysplastic hip joint. Further studies are required to study the long-term efficacy of gait, chronic pain, and progression of osteoarthritis.",

Visual loss occurs frequently, as a result of tumor expansion and compression of the optic chiasm and optic nerves. Additionally, with pituitary tumor invasion into the fixed space of the cavernous sinus, compression of multiple cranial nerves can result in cavernous sinus syndrome (CSS). We describe a case of an undiagnosed pituitary tumor manifesting as abrupt PA with CSS during hemodialysis (HD). <i>Clinical Case</i>. A 77-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) presented with acute onset of severe headache, decreased vision, ophthalmoplegia of the left eye, and hypotension during HD. MRI of the brain revealed a 2.5&#8201;cm pituitary adenoma with acute hemorrhage, compression of the left prechiasmatic optic nerve, and invasion into the left cavernous sinus (CS). The hormonal profile was consistent with multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies. The patient was treated with glucocorticoids and underwent transsphenoidal resection of the tumor. He had an uneventful postoperative hospital course, and his left visual acuity stabilized, although there was no immediate improvement in his other ocular symptoms.",

Accurate seizure recording particularly at night can be challenging in PwID. Neuro Event Labs seizure monitoring (Nelli) uses high-quality video based artificial intelligence to detect and record possible nocturnal seizures. This study looks to evaluate the clinical utility and acceptability of Nelli in PwID and epilepsy. Family/carers of PwID and drug resistant epilepsy with suspicions of nocturnal seizures who had not tolerated routine or ambulatory EEGs were invited to evaluate Nelli. Relevant demographics and clinical characteristics were collected. Nelli's impact, it's facilitators, barriers and feedback quality was captured from patient and professional stakeholders. Quantitative and thematic analysis was undertaken. Fifteen PwID and epilepsy and four health professionals were involved. Nelli recorded 707 possible seizure events across the study cohort of which 247 were not heard or recognised by carers. Carers recorded 165 episodes of 'restless' or \"seizure behaviour\" which the Nelli did not deem to be seizures. There was 93% acceptability. Thematic analysis revealed three broad themes of device acceptability, result implementation and possible seizure recognition ability. Nelli allowed for improved communication and care planning in a hitherto difficult to investigate population.",

Mechanochemistry including curing and aging under thermal as well as mechanical loading causes a multiphysics problem to be discussed. For restricting the variety of material models based on empirical observations, we aim at a thermodynamically sound strategy for modeling thermosets.

Such divergence can also be seen in genetic ALS cases with varying phenotypes bearing specific mutations, suggesting epigenetic mechanisms like DNA methylation act as disease modifiers. However, the epigenotype dictated by, in addition to other mechanisms, DNA methylation is also strongly influenced by the individual's genotype. Hence, we performed a DNA methylation study using EPIC arrays on 7 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant for ALS in whole blood, which serves as an ideal model for eliminating the effects of the genetic-epigenetic interplay to a large extent. We found one CpG site showing intra-pair hypermethylation in the affected co-twins, which maps to the Glutamate Ionotropic Receptor Kainate Type Subunit 1 gene (<i>GRIK1)</i>. Additionally, we found 4 DMPs which were subsequently confirmed using 2 different statistical approaches. Differentially methylated regions or blocks could not be detected within the scope of this work. In conclusion, we revealed that despite a low sample size, monozygotic twin studies discordant for the disease can bring new insights into epigenetic processes in ALS, pointing to new target loci for further investigations.",

Thus, designing materials that can serve as both SFC materials and wound care is highly desired, and remains a challenge. Herein, we report a two-component <i>in-situ</i> hydrogel prepared from maleimide-based oxidized sodium alginate and sulfhydryl carboxymethyl-chitosan, which gelated mainly based on \"click\" chemistry and Schiff base reaction.

The <i>in vivo</i>/<i>in vitro</i> rabbit liver hemorrhage model demonstrated the effects of hydrogel in rapid hemostasis and prevention of delayed bleeding. The canine esophageal ESD model corroborated that the <i>in-situ</i> hydrogel provided good mucosal uplift and wound closure effects, and significantly accelerated wound healing with accelerating re-epithelization and ECM remodeling post-ESD.

Hence, there are increasing demands for medical interventions to promote bone defect healing. Recombinant proteins such as BMP-2 have been recognized as one of the powerful osteogenic substances that promote mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to osteoblast differentiation and are widely applied clinically for bone defect repairs. However, recent reports show that BMP-2 treatment has been associated with clinical adverse side effects such as ectopic bone formation, osteolysis and stimulation of inflammation. Here, we have identified one new osteogenic protein, named 'HKUOT-S2' protein, from <i>Dioscorea opposita</i> Thunb<i>.</i> Using the bone defect model, we have shown that the HKUOT-S2 protein can accelerate bone defect repair by activating the mTOR signaling axis of MSCs-derived osteoblasts and increasing osteoblastic biomineralization. The HKUOT-S2 protein can also modulate the transcriptomic changes of macrophages, stem cells, and osteoblasts, thereby enhancing the crosstalk between the polarized macrophages and MSCs-osteoblast differentiation to facilitate osteogenesis. Furthermore, this protein had no toxic effects <i>in vivo</i>. We have also identified HKUOT-S2 peptide sequence TKSSLPGQTK as a functional osteogenic unit that can promote osteoblast differentiation <i>in vitro</i>. The HKUOT-S2 protein with robust osteogenic activity could be a potential alternative osteoanabolic agent for promoting osteogenesis and bone defect repairs. We believe that the HKUOT-S2 protein may potentially be applied clinically as a new class of osteogenic agent for bone defect healing.",

The high-glucose environment leads to persistent bacterial infection and mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in chronic inflammation, abnormal vascular function, and tissue necrosis. To solve these issues, we developed a double-network hydrogel, constructed with pluronic F127 diacrylate (F127DA) and hyaluronic acid methacrylate (HAMA), and enhanced by SS31-loaded mesoporous polydopamine nanoparticles (MPDA NPs). As components, SS31, a mitochondria-targeted peptide, maintains mitochondrial function, reduces mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thus regulates macrophage polarization, as well as promoting cell proliferation and migration, while MPDA NPs not only scavenge ROS and exert an anti-bacterial effect by photothermal treatment under near-infrared light irradiation, but also control release of SS31 in response to ROS. This F127DA/HAMA-MPDA@SS31 (FH-M@S) hydrogel has characteristics of adhesion, superior biocompatibility and mechanical properties which can adapt to irregular wounds at different body sites and provide sustained release of MPDA@SS31 (M@S) NPs. In addition, in a diabetic rat full thickness skin defect model, the FH-M@S hydrogel promoted macrophage M2 polarization, collagen deposition, neovascularization and wound healing. Therefore, the FH-M@S hydrogel exhibits promising therapeutic potential for skin regeneration.",

In order to address this matter, the present study was conducted in an aim to assess the use of DW-MRI in guiding radiotherapy treatments, by comparing its performance to that of other imaging procedures. Specifically, the exposure dosages to organs at risk, including the lungs, heart and spinal mencord, were evaluated using various radiotherapy regimes. The findings of the present study demonstrated that DW-MRI is a non-invasive and cost-effective imaging procedure that can be used to reduce lung exposure doses, minimizing the risk of radiation pneumonitis. The data further demonstrate the immense potential of the DW-MRI procedure in the precision radiotherapy of lung cancers.",

Exaggerated structures are often costly and, therefore, thought to be expressed in a condition-dependent manner. Sexual selection theory thus predicts a direct link between directional sexual selection, sexual dimorphism, and sex-specific condition dependence. However, only a handful of studies investigate the relationship between sexual dimorphism and condition dependence. Using 21 genetic lines of <i>Drosophila prolongata</i>, we here compared the degree of sexual dimorphism and sex-specific condition dependence, measured as allometric slopes, in sexually selected and non-sexual traits. Our data revealed male-biased sexual dimorphism in all traits examined, most prominently in the sexually selected forelegs. However, there was no relationship between the degree of sex-specific condition dependence and sexual dimorphism across traits and genetic lines. Our results contradict theoretical predictions and highlight the importance of understanding the role of exaggerated traits in the context of both sexual and natural selection.",

The thin gold film improved the laser absorptivity, decreasing the ripple generation threshold in liquids. High spatial frequency ripples exhibited lower angular deviation than low spatial frequency ones, but in water the deviation was comparable for both types of ripples. The initiation of nanoripples may precede nanoparticle generation, which is why in hexane several cuboid Au particles were trapped between the ripples. Fast cooling processes freeze ejected molten droplets during the phase explosion and surface reorganization. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction of samples processed in butanol showed a small shift toward smaller angles for the Ni phase, indicating a lattice expansion due to higher tensile stress. Confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy detected surface graphitization and amorphization in areas laser-treated in ethanol, butanol, and hexane, with the highest carbonization observed in butanol. Presumably, femtosecond laser-induced photolysis triggers the formation of graphite nanocrystallites, and consecutive pulses cause amorphization. Static contact angle measurements showed a general tendency toward hydrophobicity with highest contact angles for rippled areas created in butanol.",

Parents facilitated their children's involvement by sharing information and seeking their opinions. Whereas some participants described youth as having a substantial decision-making role, not all youth felt they were involved, and some youth could not recall conversations about rhGH. Parents can bolster youth involvement by having conversations using developmentally appropriate language, which is critical to youth feeling empowered and developing efficacy over their own care.",

GIP is important in a multitude of contexts from cancer, to microbial infections, to biofouling, yet our understanding of its origin and molecular consequences remains limited. Here, we combine microfluidic confinement of the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, with rheological measurements using genetically encoded multimeric nanoparticles (GEMs) to reveal that growth-induced pressure is accompanied with an increase in a key cellular physical property: macromolecular crowding. We develop a fully calibrated model that predicts how increased macromolecular crowding hinders protein expression and thus diminishes cell growth. This model is sufficient to explain the coupling of growth rate to pressure without the need for specific molecular sensors or signaling cascades. As molecular crowding is similar across all domains of life, this could be a deeply conserved mechanism of biomechanical feedback that allows environmental sensing originating from the fundamental physical properties of cells.",

The succession of these fungi could benefit beetle hosts by optimal consumption of the substrate and extended longevity of the nest. However, abundances of fungal cultivars and other symbionts are poorly known and their culture-independent quantification over development has been studied in only a single species. Here, for the first time, we compared the diversity and succession of both fungal and bacterial communities of fungus gardens in the fruit-tree pinhole borer, <i>Xyleborinus saxesenii</i>, from field and laboratory nests over time. By amplicon sequencing of probed fungus gardens of both nest types at three development phases we showed an extreme reduction of diversity in both bacterial and fungal symbionts in laboratory nests. Furthermore, we observed a general transition from nutritional to non-beneficial fungal symbionts during beetle development. While one known nutritional mutualist, <i>Raffaelea canadensis</i>, was occurring more or less stable over time, the second mutualist <i>R. sulphurea</i> was dominating young nests and decreased in abundance at the expense of other secondary fungi. The quicker the succession proceeded, the slower offspring beetles developed, suggesting a negative role of these secondary symbionts. Finally, we found signs of transgenerational costs of late dispersal for daughters, possibly as early dispersers transmitted and started their own nests with less of the non-beneficial taxa. Future studies should focus on the functional roles of the few bacterial taxa that were present in both field and laboratory nests.",

      "original_csv_abstract": "Bovine mastitis is the most frequent and costly disease that affects dairy cattle. Non-aureus staphylococci (NAS) are currently one of the main pathogens associated with difficult-to-treat intramammary infections. Biofilm is an important virulence factor that can protect bacteria against antimicrobial treatment and prevent their recognition by the host's immune system. Previously, we found that chronic mastitis isolates which were refractory to antibiotic therapy developed strong biofilm biomass. Now, we evaluated the influence of biofilm biomass intensity on the antibiotic resistance pattern in strong and weak biofilm-forming NAS isolates from clinical mastitis. We also assessed the effect of cloxacillin (Clx) and chitosan (Ch), either alone or in combination, on NAS isolates with different lifestyles and abilities to form biofilm. The antibiotic resistance pattern was not the same in strong and weak biofilm producers, and there was a significant association (<i>p</i>&#8201;&#8804;&#8201;0.01) between biofilm biomass intensity and antibiotic resistance. Bacterial viability assays showed that a similar antibiotic concentration was effective at killing both groups when they grew planktonically. In contrast, within biofilm the concentrations needed to eliminate strong producers were 16 to 128 times those needed for weak producers, and more than 1,000 times those required for planktonic cultures. Moreover, Ch alone or combined with Clx had significant antimicrobial activity, and represented an improvement over the activity of the antibiotic on its own, independently of the bacterial lifestyle, the biofilm biomass intensity or the antibiotic resistance pattern. In conclusion, the degree of protection conferred by biofilm against antibiotics appears to be associated with the intensity of its biomass, but treatment with Ch might be able to help counteract it. These findings suggest that bacterial biomass should be considered when designing new antimicrobial therapies aimed at reducing antibiotic concentrations while improving cure rates.",

The genome of <i>L. plantarum</i> YW11 was found to be composed of a circular single chromosome of 4,597,470&#8201;bp with a G&#8201;+&#8201;C content of 43.2%. A total of 4,278 open reading frames (ORFs) were identified in the genome and the coding density was found to be 87.8%. A comparative genomic analysis was conducted using two other <i>L. plantarum</i> strains, <i>L. plantarum</i> C11 and <i>L. plantarum</i> LMG21703. Genomic comparison revealed that <i>L. plantarum</i> YW11 shared 72.7 and 75.2% of gene content with <i>L. plantarum</i> C11 and <i>L. plantarum</i> LMG21703, respectively. Most of the genes shared between the three <i>L. plantarum</i> strains were involved in carbohydrate metabolism, energy production and conversion, amino acid metabolism, and transcription. In this analysis, 10 previously sequenced entire genomes of the species were compared using an <i>in-silico</i> technique to discover genomic divergence in genes linked with carbohydrate intake and their potential adaptations to distinct human intestinal environments. The subspecies pan-genome was open, which correlated with its extraordinary capacity to colonize several environments. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the novel genomes were homogenously grouped among subspecies of l <i>Lactiplantibacillus. L. plantarum</i> was resistant to cefoxitin, erythromycin, and metronidazole, inhibited pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium difficile, Vibrio cholera, and others, and had excellent aerotolerance, which is useful for industrial operations. The comparative genomic analysis of <i>L. plantarum</i> YW11 isolated from Tibetan kefir can provide insights into the genetic characteristics of the strain, which can be used to further understand its role in the production of kefir.",

In our study we were able to isolate and determine the structures of four suomilides, named suomilide B - E (<b>1</b>-<b>4</b>). The compounds differ from the previously isolated suomilide A by the functionalization of the glycosyl group. Compounds <b>1</b>-<b>4</b> were assayed for anti-proliferative, anti-biofilm and anti-bacterial activities, but no significant activity was detected. The sequenced genome of the producer organism <i>Nostoc</i> sp. KVJ20 enabled us to propose a biosynthetic gene cluster for suomilides. Our findings indicated that the azabicyclononane core of the suomilides is derived from prephenate and is most likely incorporated by a proline specific non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-unit.",

In this study, EV and functional proteins were found in five different commercial dairy-fermented products carrying <i>L. paracasei</i>. Strains present in those products were isolated, and with one exception, all produced small EVs (24-47 d.nm) carrying P40 and P75. In order to winnow bacterial EV from milk EV, products were subjected to centrifugal fractionation at 15,000 &#215; <i>g</i> (15 K), 33,000 &#215; <i>g</i> (33 K), and 100,000 &#215; <i>g</i> (100 K). P75 was present in all supernatants and pellets, but P40 was only found in two products bound to the 15 and 33 K pellets, and 16S rDNA of <i>L. paracasei</i> could be amplified from all 100 K EVs, indicating the presence of <i>L. paracasei</i> EV. To investigate the interactions of bacterial EV and proteins with milk EV, <i>L. paracasei</i> BL23 EV was added to three commercial UHT milk products. Small-size vesicles (50-60 d.nm) similar to <i>L. paracasei</i> BL23 EV were found in samples from 100 K centrifugations, but intriguingly, P40 and P75 were bound to EV in 15 and 33 K pellets, containing bovine milk EV of larger size (200-300 d.nm). Sequencing 16S rDNA bands amplified from EV evidenced the presence of bacterial EVs of diverse origins in milk and fermented products. Furthermore, <i>L. paracasei</i> 16S rDNA could be amplified with species-specific primers from all samples, showing the presence of <i>L. paracasei</i> EV in all EV fractions (15, 33, and 100 K), suggesting that these bacterial EVs possibly aggregate and are co-isolated with EV from milk. P40 and P75 proteins would be interacting with specific populations of milk EV (15 and 33 K) because they were detected bound to them in fermented products and milk, and this possibly forced the sedimentation of part of <i>L. paracasei</i> EV at lower centrifugal forces. This study has solved technically complex problems and essential questions which will facilitate new research focusing on the molecular behavior of probiotics during fermentation and the mechanisms of action mediating the health benefits of fermented products.",

To better understand this detrimental potential, investigations on the reservoirs of bacterial pathogens and antimicrobial resistance on the surfaces of gymnastic equipment were performed by analyzing the bacterial community structures, prevalence of viable bacteria, and presence of antimicrobial resistance on both indoor and outdoor gymnastic facilities. The results of high-throughput 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing showed that Gram-positive bacteria on the surfaces of indoor gymnastic equipment significantly enriched, including the opportunistic pathogen <i>Staphylococcus</i> strains, while Enterobacteriaceae significantly enriched on surfaces of outdoor gymnastic equipment. The analysis of &#945;-diversities showed a higher richness and diversity for bacterial communities on the surfaces of gymnastic equipment than the environment. Analysis of &#946;-diversities showed that the bacterial communities on the surfaces of gymnastic equipment differ significantly from environmental bacterial communities, while the bacterial communities on indoor and outdoor equipment are also significantly different. Thirty-four bacterial isolates were obtained from the surfaces of gymnastic equipment, including three multidrug <i>Staphylococcus</i> and one multidrug resistant <i>Pantoea</i>. In particular, <i>Staphylococcus hemolyticus</i> 5-6, isolated from the dumbbell surface, is a multidrug resistant, hemolytic, high- risk pathogen. The results of quantitative PCR targeting antibiotic resistance related genes (<i>intI1</i>, <i>sul1</i> and <i>bla</i> <sub>TEM</sub>) showed that the abundances of <i>sul1</i> and <i>bla</i> <sub>TEM</sub> genes on the surfaces of gymnastic equipment are higher than the environment, while the abundances of <i>sul1</i> gene on indoor equipment are higher than outdoor equipment. These results lead to the conclusion that the surfaces of gymnastic equipment are potential dissemination pathways for highly dangerous pathogens as well as antimicrobial resistance, and the risks of indoor equipment are higher than outdoor equipment.",

They contain neutral lipids, tocopherols, quinones, chlorophyll metabolites, carotenoids and their derivatives. Proteomic studies indicated that plastoglobules are involved in carotenoid metabolism and storage. In this study, one of the plastid lipid-associated proteins (PAP), the major protein in plastoglobules, was selected and overexpressed in <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i>. The diameter of the plastoglobules in mutants was decreased by a mean of 19.2% versus the wild-type, while the fucoxanthin level was increased by a mean of 51.2%. All mutants exhibited morphological differences from the wild-type, including a prominent increase in the transverse diameter. Moreover, the unsaturated fatty acid levels were increased in different mutants, including an 18.9-59.3% increase in eicosapentaenoic acid content. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that PAP expression and the morphological changes altered xanthophyll synthesis and storage, which affected the assembly of the fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c-binding protein and expression of antenna proteins as well as reduced the non-photochemical quenching activity of diatom cells. Therefore, metabolic regulation at the suborganelle level can be achieved by modulating PAP expression. These findings provide a subcellular structural site and target for synthetic biology to modify pigment and lipid metabolism in microalgae chassis cells.",

Current anti-viral strategies focus on vaccination or targeting key viral proteins with antibodies and drugs. However, the ongoing evolution of new variants that evade vaccination or may become drug-resistant is a major challenge. Thus, antiviral compounds that circumvent these obstacles are needed. Here we describe an innovative antiviral modality based on <i>in silico</i> designed fully synthetic mRNA that is replication incompetent in uninfected cells (termed herein PSCT: parasitic anti-SARS-CoV-2 transcript). The PSCT sequence was engineered to include key untranslated cis-acting regulatory RNA elements of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, so as to effectively compete for replication and packaging with the standard viral genome. Using the Vero E6 cell-culture based SARS-CoV-2 infection model, we determined that the intracellular delivery of liposome-encapsulated PSCT at 1 hour post infection significantly reduced intercellular SARS-CoV-2 replication and release into the extracellular milieu as compared to mock treatment. In summary, our findings are a proof-of-concept for the therapeutic feasibility of <i>in silico</i> designed mRNA compounds formulated to hinder the replication and packaging of ssRNA viruses sharing a comparable genomic-structure with beta-CoVs.",

      "original_csv_abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 sparked intensive research into the development of effective vaccines, 50 of which have been approved thus far, including the novel mRNA-based vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna. Although limiting the severity of the disease, the mRNA-based vaccines presented drawbacks, such as the cold chain requirement. Moreover, antibody levels generated by these vaccines decline significantly after 6\u2009months. These vaccines deliver mRNA encoding the full-length spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, but must be updated as new strains and variants of concern emerge, creating a demand for adjusted formulations and booster campaigns. To overcome these challenges, we have developed COVID-19 vaccine candidates based on the highly conserved SARS CoV-2, 809-826 B-cell peptide epitope (denoted 826) conjugated to cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) nanoparticles and bacteriophage Q\u03b2 virus-like particles, both platforms have exceptional thermal stability and facilitate epitope delivery with inbuilt adjuvant activity. We evaluated two administration methods: subcutaneous injection and an implantable polymeric scaffold. Mice received a prime-boost regimen of 100\u2009\u03bcg per dose (2\u2009weeks apart) or a single dose of 200\u2009\u03bcg administered as a liquid formulation, or a polymer implant. Antibody titers were evaluated longitudinally over 50\u2009weeks. The vaccine candidates generally elicited an early Th2-biased immune response, which stimulates the production of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, followed by a switch to a Th1-biased response for most formulations. Exceptionally, vaccine candidate 826-CPMV (administered as prime-boost, soluble injection) elicited a balanced Th1/Th2 immune response, which is necessary to prevent pulmonary immunopathology associated with Th2 bias extremes. While the Q\u03b2-based vaccine elicited overall higher antibody titers, the CPMV-induced antibodies had higher avidity. Regardless of the administration route and formulation, our vaccine candidates maintained high antibody titers for more than 50\u2009weeks, confirming a potent and durable immune response against SARS-CoV-2 even after a single dose.",

So far, little attention has been paid to the characterization of the aerosolization process. In this study, fecal and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) samples were collected from 20 animal farms involving swine, cattle, layers, and broilers, and the ARGs, ARB, and human pathogenic bacteria (HPB) were loaded in these two media. The results showed that approximately 70% of ARGs, 60% of ARBs, and 43% of HPBs were found to be preferential aerosolization. The bioaerosolization index (BI) of target 30 ARGs varied from 0.04 to 460.07, and the highest value was detected from <i>tetW</i>. The highest BI values of erythromycin- and tetracycline-resistant bacteria were for <i>Kocuria</i> (13119) and <i>Staphylococcus</i> (24746), respectively, and the distribution of BI in the two types of dominant ARB was similar. Regarding the bioaerosolization behavior of HPB, <i>Clostridium saccharolyticum</i> WM1 was the most easily aerosolized pathogen in swine and broiler farms, and <i>Brucella abortus</i> strain CNM 20040339 had the highest value in cattle and layer farms. Notably, the highest BI values for ARGs, ARB, and HPB were universally detected on chicken farms. Most ARGs, ARB, and HPB positively correlated with animal age, stocking density, and breeding area. Temperature and relative humidity have significant effects on the aerosolization behavior of targets, and the effects of these two parameters on the same target are usually opposite. The results of this study provide a basis for a better understanding of the contribution of animal feces to airborne ARGs and HPBs in farms, as well as for controlling the transport of the fecal microbiome to the environment through the aerosolization pathway.",

In addition, the yield and quality of flue-cured tobacco in the BS region were significantly higher than those in the ZD region, and the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Bacillus in the rhizosphere microbiota of flue-cured tobacco in the BS region at the D60 transplant stage was significantly higher than that in the ZD region. In addition, the results of the hierarchical sample metabolic pathway abundance map showed that the PWY-6572 metabolic pathway was mainly realized by <i>Paenibacillus</i>, and that the relative abundance of flue-cured tobacco rhizosphere microbiota (<i>Paenibacillus</i>) participating in PWY-6572 in the D60 transplant period in the BS region was significantly higher than that in the ZD region. In conclusion, different transplanting periods of flue-cured tobacco have important effects on soil physical and chemical properties and rhizosphere microbial communities. There were significant differences in the rhizosphere microbiota and function of flue-cured tobacco in different regions, which may affect the performance and quality of this type of tobacco.",

The isolation and relatively late arrival of humans into New Zealand has meant there is a recorded history of the introduction of domestic species. Honey bees (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) were introduced to New Zealand in 1839, and the disease American foulbrood was subsequently found in the 1870s. <i>Paenibacillus larvae</i>, the causative agent of American foulbrood, has been genome sequenced in other countries. We sequenced the genomes of <i>P. larvae</i> obtained from 164 New Zealand apiaries where American foulbrood was identified in symptomatic hives during visual inspection. Multi-locus sequencing typing (MLST) revealed the dominant sequence type to be ST18, with this clonal cluster accounting for 90.2% of isolates. Only two other sequence types (with variants) were identified, ST5 and ST23. ST23 was only observed in the Otago area, whereas ST5 was limited to two geographically non-contiguous areas. The sequence types are all from the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus I (ERIC I) genogroup. The ST18 and ST5 from New Zealand and international <i>P. larvae</i> all clustered by sequence type. Based on core genome MLST and SNP analysis, localized regional clusters were observed within New Zealand, but some closely related genomes were also geographically dispersed, presumably due to hive movements by beekeepers.",

Magroviruses - the viruses of MGII archaea have been recently found to occur ubiquitously in surface ocean. However, their diversity, distribution, and potential ecological functions in coastal zones especially brackish waters are unknown. Here we obtained 234 non-redundant magroviral genomes from brackish surface waters by using homology searches for viral signature proteins highlighting the uncovered vast diversity of this novel viral group. Phylogenetic analysis based on these brackish magroviruses along with previously reported marine ones identified six taxonomic groups with close evolutionary connection to both haloviruses and the viruses of Marine Group I archaea. Magroviruses were present abundantly both in brackish and open ocean samples with some showing habitat specification and others having broad spectrums of distribution between different habitats. Genome annotation suggests they may be involved in regulating multiple metabolic pathways of MGII archaea. Our results uncover the previously overlooked diversity and ecological potentials of a major archaeal virial group in global ocean and brackish waters and shed light on the cryptic evolutionary history of archaeal viruses.",

In the treatment of T2DM, synbiotics often regulate the composition of intestinal flora, which autoinducer-2 (AI-2) may play an important role. Whether the changes of intestinal flora are related to AI-2 during synbiotics treatment of T2DM is a topic worth studying. We elucidated the effects of synbiotic composed of mangiferin and <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i> 1-12 (SML) on T2DM rats. Male Spraque-Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with streptozotocin (STZ) and randomly grouped. After that, biochemical parameters, intestinal flora, fecal AI-2, and intestinal colonization of <i>L. reuteri</i> were detected. The results showed that SML had a hypoglycemic effect and mitigated the organ lesions of the liver and pancreas. Also, SML regulated biochemical parameters such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), lipopolysaccharides (LPS), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;). On the other hand, the proportion of probiotics, such as <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus</i>, <i>L. reuteri</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium pseudolongum</i>, <i>Lactobacillus murinus</i>, and <i>Lactobacillus johnsonii</i>, were elevated by the treatment of SML. In addition, SML promoted the colonization and proliferation of <i>L. reuteri</i> in the gut. Another thing to consider was that AI-2 was positively correlated with the total number of OTUs sequences and SML boosted AI-2 in the gut. Taken together, these results supported that SML may modulate intestinal flora through AI-2 to treat T2DM. This study provided a novel alternative strategy for the treatment of T2DM in future.",

It derives from Biopiles, but phytoremediation is added to biostimulation with nitrogen fertilization and bioaugmentation with local bacteria. We have constructed seven Ecopiles with soil heavily polluted with hydrocarbons in Carlow (Ireland). The aim of the study was to analyze changes in the microbial community during ecopiling. In the course of 18\u2009months of remediation, total petroleum hydrocarbons values decreased in 99 and 88% on average for aliphatics and aromatics, respectively, indicating a successful biodegradation. Community analysis showed that bacterial alfa diversity (Shannon Index), increased with the degradation of hydrocarbons, starting at an average value of 7.59 and ending at an average value of 9.38. Beta-diversity analysis, was performed using Bray-Curtis distances and PCoA ordination, where the two first principal components (PCs) explain the 17 and 14% of the observed variance, respectively. The results show that samples tend to cluster by sampling time instead of by Ecopile. This pattern is supported by the hierarchical clustering analysis, where most samples from the same timepoint clustered together. We used DSeq2 to determine the differential abundance of bacterial populations in Ecopiles at the beginning and the end of the treatment. While TPHs degraders are more abundant at the start of the experiment, these populations are substituted by bacterial populations typical of clean soils by the end of the biodegradation process. Similar results are found for the fungal community, indicating that the microbial community follows a succession along the process. This succession starts with a TPH degraders or tolerant enriched community, and finish with a microbial community typical of clean soils.",

In tropical dry forests, edaphic ecosystem engineering by biological soil crusts (biocrusts) could impact regeneration by influencing erosion control and soil water and nutrient fluxes, which impact landscape hydrology, geomorphology, and ecosystem functioning. This study investigated the effect of cyanobacteria-dominated biocrusts on water infiltration and aggregate stability in a human-modified landscape of the Caatinga dry forest (NE Brazil), a system characterized by high levels of forest degradation and increasing aridity. By trapping dust and swelling of cyanobacterial filaments, biocrusts can seal soil surfaces and slow down infiltration, which potentially induces erosion. To quantify hydraulic properties and erosion control, we used minidisc-infiltrometry, raindrop-simulation, and wet sieving at two sites with contrasting disturbance levels: an active cashew plantation and an abandoned field experiencing forest regeneration, both characterized by sandy soils. Under disturbance, biocrusts had a stronger negative impact on infiltration (reduction by 42% vs. 37% during regeneration), although biocrusts under regenerating conditions had the lowest absolute sorptivity (0.042&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.02 cm&#8201;s<sup>-1/2</sup>) and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (0.0015&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.0008 cm&#8201;s<sup>-1</sup>), with a doubled water repellency. Biocrusts provided high soil aggregate stability although stability increased considerably with progression of biocrust succession (raindrop simulation disturbed: 0.19&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.22 J vs. regenerating: 0.54&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.22 J). The formation of stable aggregates by early successional biocrusts on sandy soils suggests protection of dry forest soils even on the worst land use/soil degradation scenario with a high soil erosion risk. Our results confirm that biocrusts covering bare interspaces between vascular plants in human-modified landscapes play an important role in surface water availability and erosion control. Biocrusts have the potential to reduce land degradation, but their associated ecosystem services like erosion protection, can be impaired by disturbance. Considering an average biocrust coverage of 8.1% of the Caatinga landscapes, further research should aim to quantify the contribution of biocrusts to forest recovery to fully understand the role they play in the functioning of this poorly explored ecosystem.",

However, the influences of dietary non-fibrous carbohydrate (NFC) to neutral detergent fiber (NDF) in different ratios on gut microbiota, metabolites, intestinal immunity, and growth performance have not been fully explored. A total of 135 healthy weaned rabbits (45.1 &#177; 0.7 d of age) with an average body weight of 1.08 &#177; 0.07 kg were randomly divided into five groups. Under the same other nutrient levels, rabbits were fed diets with NFC/NDF ratios of 0.7 (T1), 1.0 (T2), 1.3 (T3), 1.6 (T4), and 1.9 (T5). During the 28-day experiment, T3 rabbits showed the highest final body weight and the lowest feed-to-weight ratio than T5 rabbits (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) but no significant difference with T1 or T2 rabbits. The expression of cecal pro-inflammatory factors IL-1&#946; and TNF-&#945; was increased in the T4 and T5 than in those of other groups (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Conversely, the tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Claudin-1, and Occludin) were decreased to varying degrees in the T4 and T5 groups. The pH value in the cecal digesta of T5 rabbits was lower than that of T1, T2, and T3 (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), while the concentration of volatile fatty acids and propionate was higher than those of T1, T2, and T3 rabbits (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). In terms of gut microbiota, at the phylum level, the relative burden of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria in T2 rabbits was the highest (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), and the relative burden of Proteobacteria in T5 rabbits was higher than that of other groups (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). At the genus level, the relative burden of <i>Ruminococcus</i> was higher in T2 and T3 rabbits than that of other groups, and T5 rabbits have the lowest relative burden of <i>Ruminococcus</i>. Combination analysis showed that cecal metabolites were positively associated with fermentation-related phenotypes and the burden of Firmicutes (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, different dietary NFC/NDF ratios can affect the intestinal immune response and growth performance of rabbits, and there was a positive effect when dietary NFC/NDF = 1.0-1.3.",

In this study, we investigate replication-induced gene copy numbers - a regulatory concept that is unlike the others not based on modulation of promoter activity but on replication dynamics. We show that a large fraction of genes are predominantly affected by transient copy numbers and identify cellular functions and central pathways governed by this mechanism in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Furthermore, we show quantitatively that the previously observed spatio-temporal expression pattern between different growth phases mainly emerges from transient chromosomal copy numbers. We extend the analysis to the plant pathogen <i>Dickeya dadantii</i> and the biotechnologically relevant organism <i>Vibrio natriegens</i>. The analysis reveals a connection between growth phase dependent gene expression and evolutionary gene migration in these species. A further extension to the bacterial kingdom indicates that chromosome evolution is governed by growth rate related transient copy numbers.",

However, the relationship between the large-scale secretome of phytopathogenic fungi and their lifestyle is not fully understood. In the present study, the secretomes of 150 plant pathogenic fungi were predicted and the characteristics associated with different lifestyles were investigated. In total, 94,974 secreted proteins (SPs) were predicted from these fungi. The number of the SPs ranged from 64 to 1,662. Among these fungi, hemibiotrophic fungi had the highest number (average of 970) and proportion (7.1%) of SPs. Functional annotation showed that hemibiotrophic and necrotroph fungi, differ from biotrophic and symbiotic fungi, contained much more carbohydrate enzymes, especially polysaccharide lyases and carbohydrate esterases. Furthermore, the core and lifestyle-specific SPs orthogroups were identified. Twenty-seven core orthogroups contained 16% of the total SPs and their motif function annotation was represented by serine carboxypeptidase, carboxylesterase and asparaginase. In contrast, 97 lifestyle-specific orthogroups contained only 1% of the total SPs, with diverse functions such as PAN_AP in hemibiotroph-specific and flavin monooxygenases in necrotroph-specific. Moreover, obligate biotrophic fungi had the largest number of effectors (average of 150), followed by hemibiotrophic fungi (average of 120). Among these effectors, 4,155 had known functional annotation and pectin lyase had the highest proportion in the functionally annotated effectors. In addition, 32 sets of RNA-Seq data on pathogen-host interactions were collected and the expression levels of SPs were higher than that of non-SPs, and the expression level of effector genes was higher in biotrophic and hemibiotrophic fungi than in necrotrophic fungi, while secretase genes were highly expressed in necrotrophic fungi. Finally, the secretory activity of five predicted SPs from <i>Setosphearia turcica</i> was experimentally verified. In conclusion, our results provide a foundation for the study of pathogen-host interaction and help us to understand the fungal lifestyle adaptation.",

However, summer conditions in this region may exceed the temperature tolerance of most currently cultivated microalgae. The Cyanidiophyceae are a class of polyextremophilic red algae that natively inhabit acidic hot springs. <i>C. merolae</i> 10D has recently emerged as an interesting model organism capable of high-cell density cultivation on pure CO<sub>2</sub> with optimal growth at elevated temperatures and acidic pH. <i>C. merolae</i> biomass has an interesting macromolecular composition, is protein rich, and contains valuable bio-products like heat-stable phycocyanin, carotenoids, &#946;-glucan, and starch. Here, photobioreactors were used to model <i>C. merolae</i> 10D growth performance in simulated environmental conditions of the mid-Red Sea coast across four seasons, it was then grown at various scales outdoors in Thuwal, Saudi Arabia during the Summer of 2022. We show that <i>C. merolae</i> 10D is amenable to cultivation with industrial-grade nutrient and CO<sub>2</sub> inputs outdoors in this location and that its biomass is relatively constant in biochemical composition across culture conditions. We also show the adaptation of <i>C. merolae</i> 10D to high salinity levels of those found in Red Sea waters and conducted further modeled cultivations in nutrient enriched local sea water. It was determined that salt-water adapted <i>C. merolae</i> 10D could be cultivated with reduced nutrient inputs in local conditions. The results presented here indicate this may be a promising alternative species for algal bioprocesses in outdoor conditions in extreme coastal desert summer environments.",

The overall impact pertaining to significant membrane changes, through broad spectrum drugs have rendered the bacteria resistant over the years. The economic expenditure due to increasing drug resistance poses a global burden on healthcare community and must be dealt with immediate effect. Nanoparticles (NP) have demonstrated inherent therapeutic potential or can serve as nanocarriers of antibiotics against multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens. These carriers can mask the antibiotics and help evade the resistance mechanism of the bacteria. The targeted delivery can be fine-tuned through surface functionalization of Nanocarriers using aptamers, antibodies etc. This review covers various molecular mechanisms acquired by resistant bacteria towards membrane modification. Mechanistic insight on 'NP surface-bacterial membrane' interactions are crucial in deciding the role of NP as therapeutic. Finally, we highlight the potential accessible membrane targets for designing smart surface-functionalized nanocarriers which can act as bacteria-targeted robots over the existing clinically available antibiotics. As the bacterial strains around us continue to evolve into resistant versions, nanomedicine can offer promising and alternative tools in overcoming AMR.",

Low DNA sequencing cost may facilitate the identification of the genomic profile leading to resistance, the resistome, to rationally optimize the design of antifungal therapies. However, compared to bacteria, initiatives for resistome detection in eukaryotic pathogens are underdeveloped. Firstly, reported mutations in antifungal targets leading to reduced susceptibility must be extensively collected from the literature to generate comprehensive databases. This information should be complemented with specific laboratory screenings to detect the highest number possible of relevant genetic changes in primary targets and associations between resistance and other genomic markers. Strikingly, some drug resistant strains experience high-level genetic changes such as ploidy variation as much as duplications and reorganizations of specific chromosomes. Such variations involve allelic dominance, gene dosage increments and target expression regime effects that should be explicitly parameterized in antifungal resistome prediction algorithms. Clinical data indicate that predictors need to consider the precise pathogen species and drug levels of detail, instead of just genus and drug class. The concomitant needs for mutation accuracy and assembly quality assurance suggest hybrid sequencing approaches involving third-generation methods will be utilized. Moreover, fatal fast infections, like fungemia and meningitis, will further require both sequencing and analysis facilities are available in-house. Altogether, the complex nature of antifungal resistance demands extensive sequencing, data acquisition and processing, bioinformatic analysis pipelines, and standard protocols to be accomplished prior to genome-based protocols are applied in the clinical setting.",

To our knowledge, there is a paucity of information on antifungal potential of liquid smoke against toxigenic fungi like <i>Aspergillus flavus</i> that produce mycotoxins in human and pet foods. Semi-moist pet food with high moisture content (20-30%) is susceptible to mold contamination and requires intervention. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of liquid smoke preparations on the growth of wild-type mold and <i>A. flavus</i> in semi-moist pet food. Semi-moist pet food was formulated with eight different liquid smoke preparations (S1-S8) containing varying amounts of organic acids, phenol and carbonyl compounds (ranging from low to high) at 0% (untreated), 0.5, 1, 2, and 4% (w/w). A positive control consisted of 0.2% potassium sorbate known to inhibit mold growth. Shelf life was estimated by storing the samples at 28&#176;C and 65-70% RH over 30 days and recording the number of days until the appearance of visible wild-type mold. In another experiment, samples were spot inoculated with <i>A. flavus</i> (&#8764;10,000 CFU/mL), incubated at 25&#176;C, and analyzed for fungal growth at sampling intervals of 2 days over a 35-day period. Liquid smoke at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4% extended the shelf life of samples on an average by a total of 11.6, 12.5, 17.2, and 24.1 days when compared to the untreated samples (7.7 days). The smoke preparations Cloud S-C100 (S3) and Code-10 (S6) (high carbonyl, medium/low phenol) were the most effective (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) in prolonging the number of days to visible mold growth (26-28 days). In the challenge study with <i>A. flavus</i>, Cloud S-C100 (S3), Cloud S-AC15 (S8) (high to medium carbonyl, low phenol), and Code 10 (S6) (base smoke) reduced (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) mold counts by 1.0, 1.7, and 2.5 logs when compared to the untreated samples at 1, 2, and 4%, respectively. Addition of smoke at 0.5% did not reduce mold counts. The carbonyl preparations of liquid smoke were the most effective at enhancing shelf life of semi-moist pet food, and at inhibiting <i>A. flavus</i> growth.",

However, how coral-associated <i>Prosthecochloris</i> (CAP) adapts to diurnal changing microenvironments in coral skeletons is still poorly understood. In this study, three <i>Prosthecochloris</i> genomes were obtained through enrichment culture from the skeleton of the stony coral <i>Galaxea fascicularis</i>. These divergent three genomes belonged to <i>Prosthecochloris marina</i> and two genomes were circular. Comparative genomic analysis showed that between the CAP and non-CAP clades, CAP genomes possess specialized metabolic capacities (CO oxidation, CO<sub>2</sub> hydration and sulfur oxidation), gas vesicles (vertical migration in coral skeletons), and <i>cbb</i> <sub>3</sub>-type cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidases (oxygen tolerance and gene regulation) to adapt to the microenvironments of coral skeletons. Within the CAP clade, variable polysaccharide synthesis gene clusters and phage defense systems may endow bacteria with differential cell surface structures and phage susceptibility, driving strain-level evolution. Furthermore, mobile genetic elements (MGEs) or evidence of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) were found in most of the genomic loci containing the above genes, suggesting that MGEs play an important role in the evolutionary diversification between CAP and non-CAP strains and within CAP clade strains. Our results provide insight into the adaptive strategy and population evolution of endolithic <i>Prosthecochloris</i> strains in coral skeletons.",

The characterization of the PRP was compared with non-responsive micelles comprising Pluronics&#8482; P123 and F127. According to the findings, the PRP formed photo-responsive micelles in the nanometric scale (&lt; 100&#8201;nm) with a lower critical micelle concentration (3.74&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>-4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>, 5.8&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>-4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>, and 7.2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>-6</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> for PRP, F127, P123, respectively, at 25&#176;C) and higher entrapment efficiency of CUR (88.7, 77.2, and 72.3% for PRP, F127, and P123 micelles, respectively) than the pluronics evaluated.

The light-triggered release of CUR from PRP occurred with UV light irradiation (at 355&#8201;nm and 25&#8201;mW&#8201;cm<sup>-2</sup>) and a cumulative release of 88.34% of CUR within 1&#8201;h compared to 80% from pluronics after 36&#8201;h. <i>In vitro</i> studies showed that CUR-loaded PRP was non-toxic to mammal cell, showed inactivation of the pathogenic microorganisms <i>Candida albicans</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and decreased biofilm biomass when associated with blue light (455 &#8201;nm, 33.84&#8201;J/cm<sup>2</sup>).

The presence of worldwide species, the lack of systematic sampling design and adequate sampling effort, and the lack of research units are responsible for this status. This study investigates the biogeographical patterns of <i>Arthrobotrys oligospora</i>, the most widespread globally distributed nematode-trapping fungi (NTF), by stratified collecting and analyzing 2,250 samples from 228 sites in Yunnan Province, China. The <i>A. oligospora</i> was isolated, and 149 strains were subjected to ITS, TUB, TEF and RPB2 gene sequencing and multi-gene association phylogeographic analysis. The results show that at population level <i>A. oligospora</i> is randomly distributed throughout Yunnan Province and has no biogeographical distribution pattern. At the genetic level, the phylogenetic tree of <i>A. oligospora</i> diverges into five major evolutionary clades, with a low degree of gene flow between the five clades. However, the correlation between the phylogenetic diversity of <i>A. oligospora</i> and geographical factors was low. There was no clear pattern in the phylogenetic clades distribution of <i>A. oligospora</i> either without dividing the study unit or when the grid was used as the study unit. When watersheds were used as the study unit, 67.4%, 63.3%, 65.9%, 83.3%, and 66.7% of clade 1-5 strains were distributed in the Jinsha river, Red river, Peal river, Lancang river, and Nujiang-Irawaddy river watersheds, respectively. The clades distribution of <i>A. oligospora</i> was highly consistent with the watersheds distribution. Training predictions of the clades distributions using randomly generated polygons were also less accurate than watersheds. These results suggest that watersheds are key to discovering the biogeographic distribution patterns of <i>A. oligospora</i>. The <i>A. oligospora</i> populations are blocked by mountains in the watershed, and gene flow barriers have occurred, which may have resulted in the formation of multiple cryptic species. Watersheds are also ideal for understanding such speciation processes, explaining factors affecting biodiversity distribution and coupling studies of plant and animal and microbial diversity.",

It requires more synthetic fertilizers and fungicides during growth and development. However, the excess use of synthetic fertilizers and fungicides causes environmental pollution and affects cane quality and productivity. Plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) indirectly or directly promote plant growth in various ways. In this study, 22 PGPB strains were isolated from the roots of the sugarcane variety GT42. After screening of plant growth-promoting (PGP) traits, it was found that the DJ06 strain had the most potent PGP activity, which was identified as <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) labeling technology confirmed that the DJ06 strain successfully colonized sugarcane tissues. The complete genome sequencing of the DJ06 strain was performed using Nanopore and Illumina sequencing platforms. The results showed that the DJ06 strain genome size was 64,90,034 bp with a G+C content of 66.34%, including 5,912 protein-coding genes (CDSs) and 12 <i>rRNA</i> genes. A series of genes related to plant growth promotion was observed, such as nitrogen fixation, ammonia assimilation, siderophore, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), deaminase, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) production, auxin biosynthesis, phosphate metabolism, hydrolase, biocontrol, and tolerance to abiotic stresses. In addition, the effect of the DJ06 strain was also evaluated by inoculation in two sugarcane varieties GT11 and B8. The length of the plant was increased significantly by 32.43 and 12.66% and fresh weight by 89.87 and 135.71% in sugarcane GT11 and B8 at 60 days after inoculation. The photosynthetic leaf gas exchange also increased significantly compared with the control plants. The content of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) was enhanced and gibberellins (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) were reduced in response to inoculation of the DJ06 strain as compared with control in two sugarcane varieties. The enzymatic activities of oxidative, nitrogen metabolism, and hydrolases were also changed dramatically in both sugarcane varieties with inoculation of the DJ06 strain. These findings provide better insights into the interactive action mechanisms of the <i>P. aeruginosa</i> DJ06 strain and sugarcane plant development.",

The study included 4,682 subjects. Group A had the infection without an anti-S Ig response. Group B and C seroconverted for anti-N Ig between T0 and T1 and between T1 and T2, respectively. Group D was persistently anti-N Ig negative. Group B showed an initial sub-optimal response, reaching the highest titer at T3. Those who received the second dose 120 days after the infection had higher titers compared to those who received it 21 days after the first dose. The immune response depends on the number and the timing of vaccine doses, highlighting the need for a more personalized approach to vaccination.",

Therefore, GNNs are widely used in electronic shopping, drug discovery (especially for the treatment of COVID-19) and other fields, promoting the explosive development of machine learning. However, user interaction, data sharing and circulation are highly sensitive to privacy, and centralized storage can lead to data isolation. Therefore, Federated Learning with high efficiency and strong security and privacy enhancement technology based on secure aggregation can improve the security dilemma faced by GNN. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Secure Aggregation for Federated Graph Neural Network(ESA-FedGNN), which can efficiently reduce the cost of communication and avoid computational redundancy while ensuring data privacy. Firstly, a novel secret sharing scheme based on numerical analysis is proposed, which employs Fast Fourier Transform to improve the computational power of the neural network in sharing phase, and leverages Newton Interpolation method to deal with the disconnection and loss of the client in reconstruction phase. Secondly, a regular graph embedding based on geometric distribution is proposed, which optimizes the aggregation speed by using data parallelism. Finally, a double mask is adopted to ensure privacy and prevent malicious adversaries from stealing model parameters.

There is a growing concern about performing surgery for oligometastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, although there is still little evidence. We reviewed articles published between 2021 and 2022, focusing mainly on surgical outcomes. Furthermore, we summarized the current status of surgery in the multidisciplinary treatment of oligometastatic pancreatic cancer and discuss future perspectives. In liver oligometastasis, multimodal treatment including surgery achieved favorable long-term survival, especially in patients with good responses to preoperative chemotherapy, with a median survival time from 25.5 to 54.6 months. In addition, the data from the National Cancer Database in the United States showed that patients who underwent surgery for oligometastatic liver metastases had a significantly longer overall survival than those who received chemotherapy alone. Prognostic biomarkers were identified, including carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) levels at diagnosis and preoperative chemotherapy with normalization of CA19-9 levels or favorable radiological response. Patients with lung oligometastasis had a more favorable long-term prognosis than those with other recurrence sites, and the updated literature further confirmed the previous studies. Overall survival was favorable, with 84\u2009months after initial surgery and 29.2 months after metastasectomy, and a 5-year survival rate of 60.6% was also reported. In peritoneal oligometastasis, the results of conversion surgery after good responses to preoperative treatment with intraperitoneal therapy or systematic chemotherapy were reported, and the conversion rate and long-term prognosis were favorable. There is a growing concern about performing surgery for oligometastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. We reviewed articles published between 2021 and 2022, focusing mainly on surgical outcomes. Furthermore, we summarize the current status of surgery in multidisciplinary treatment of oligometastatic pancreatic cancer and discuss future perspectives.",

It seems that while the short-term outcomes of minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy (MIE-IL) were better than those of open Ivor Lewis esophagectomy (OE-IL), there were no significant differences in the long-term outcomes between MIE-IL and OE-IL. Similarly, the short-term outcomes of minimally invasive McKeown esophagectomy (MIE-MK) were better than those of open McKeown esophagectomy (OE-MK), while there were no significant differences in the long-term outcomes between MIE-MK and OE-MK. Furthermore, the short-term outcomes of robot-assisted minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy (RAMIE-IL) were superior to those of completely minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy (CMIE-IL). On the other hand, there were advantages and disadvantages in relation to the short-term outcomes of robot-assisted minimally invasive McKeown esophagectomy (RAMIE-MK) as compared with completely minimally invasive McKeown esophagectomy (CMIE-MK). However, there were no significant differences in the long-term outcomes between RAMIE-MK and CMIE-MK. Further research is needed to evaluate of short-term and long-term outcomes of transmediastinal esophagectomy with and without robotic assistance. Both induction chemotherapy and induction chemoradiotherapy appear to be promising to secure a higher rate of conversion surgery. Neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy and chemoimmunoradiotherapy have shown promising results and are expected as new powerful therapies.",

The study aims to analyse the determinants of international migration of Ethiopians to the Middle East and its impact on the income of households staying behind particularly in the Dessie Zuria district of the Amhara region in Ethiopia. Data were randomly collected from 346 households and analysed using descriptive statistics, logit regression, and Propensity Score Matching (PSM) models. The logit regression analysis indicates that bigger family size, network with migrants/returnees, and the presence of peer/family pressure influence the probability of international migration positively. On the contrary, being a male household head, ownership of larger farmland and livestock, and participation in additional non-farm activities determine international migration negatively. The findings from the PSM model revealed that international migration increased the annual income of migrant-sending households by 13,079.51 ETB per year over non-migrant sending households. However, the benefits enjoyed by the families staying behind have been at the expense of migrants, whose income is hard-earned and they often take a risky route to reach the destination regions. The findings call for an integrated policy approach to control population pressure that depletes the key financial and physical assets of households in the origin and thus forces individuals to look for alternative livelihood strategies such as migration. Location-specific policy interventions are needed to create non-farm and alternative livelihoods, improve agricultural productivity, and access information to reduce exaggerated and misleading information about the destination areas.",

It is closely associated with cirrhosis and its complications with up to more than half of cirrhotic patients demonstrating imaging findings of sarcopenia. The pathogenesis of this syndrome remains complex, including multiple factors involved in skeletal muscle homeostasis, systemic inflammation, and energy dysregulation. Many modalities exist in assessing and measuring sarcopenia. The use of cross-sectional imaging, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, with accurate and clinically proven assessment software should be considered the gold standard. Sarcopenia has become the focus of ongoing extensive research with initial findings highlighting increased mortality and complication rates in patient with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Additional studies have demonstrated reversal and improved survival in sarcopenic patients who have undergone transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement. Thus, accounting for sarcopenia can help risk stratify patients prior to interventional procedures to allow for better outcomes and improved survival.",

TIPS reduction and TIPS occlusion are therapeutic options used to mitigate overshunting, with reduction being the initial alternative due to retained shunt patency and lower potential for venous thrombosis.

Our estimates suggest Covid-19 absences have reduced the U.S. labor force by approximately 500,000 people (0.2 percent of adults) and imply an average labor supply loss per Covid-19 absence equivalent to $9,000 in forgone earnings, about 90 percent of which reflects losses beyond the initial absence week.",

Prognosis of DMG patients remains poor due to the infiltrative nature of these tumors and the protection they receive from systemically delivered therapeutics via an intact blood-brain barrier (BBB), making treatment difficult. While the cell of origin remains disputed, it is believed to reside in the ventral pons. Recent research has pointed toward epigenetic dysregulation inducing an OPC-like transcriptomic signature in DMG cells. This epigenetic dysregulation is typically caused by a mutation (K27M) in one of two histone genes-<i>H3F3A</i> or <i>HIST1H3B</i> -and can lead to a differentiation block that increases these cells oncogenic potential. Standard treatment with radiation is not sufficient at overcoming the aggressivity of this cancer and only confers a survival benefit of a few months, and thus, discovery of new therapeutics is of utmost importance. In this review, we discuss the cell of origin of DMGs, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms that contribute to their aggressivity and resistance to treatment. Additionally, we outline the current standard of care for DMG patients and the potential future therapeutics for this cancer that are currently being tested in preclinical and clinical trials.",

Two themes emerged from the interviews: (1) trust between nurse and patient is paramount; and (2) this patient population has needs that are not currently being met through the humanistic nursing approach. The results of the iterative qualitative analysis of the data suggest that humanistic nursing tailored to young men with cancer should address their need to express their feelings, to be active and to receive psychological support.",

Nurse-led models of survivorship care provided by oncology nurse practitioners (NPs) have been shown to be safe, effective, feasible, and appropriate for follow-up care (Chan et al., 2018). In the province of Ontario, survivorship care is provided mostly by physicians. Specialized NP-led survivorship clinics or programs are currently lacking based on a recent environmental scan. This paper outlines current barriers and opportunities in NP-led survivorship care.

Such slowing generally increases the probability that stopping will be successful. Surprisingly though, no study has clearly demonstrated that the speed of stopping (measured as the stop-signal reaction time, SSRT) is reduced by such proactive adjustments. In addition to a number of studies showing non-significant effects, the only study that initially had observed a clear effect in this direction found that it was artifactually driven by a confounding variable (specifically, by context-independence violations, which jeopardize the validity of the SSRT estimation). Here, we tested in two well-powered and well-controlled experiments whether the SSRT is shorter when stopping is anticipated. In each experiment, we used a Stop-Signal Task, in which the stop-trial frequency was either high (50%) or low (20%). Our results robustly show that the SSRT was shorter when stop signals were more anticipated (i.e., in the high-frequent condition) while carefully controlling for context-independence violations. Hence, our study is first to demonstrate a clear proactive benefit on the speed of stopping, in line with an ability to emphasize going or stopping, by trading off the speed of both.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "Task sets have been argued to play an important role in cognition, giving rise to the notions of needing to switch between active task sets and to control competing task sets in selective attention tasks. For example, it has been argued that Stroop interference results from two categories of conflict: <i>informational</i> and <i>task (set)</i> conflict. Informational conflict arises from processing the word and is resolved by a late selection mechanism; task conflict arises when two task sets (i.e., word reading and colour identification) compete for activation and can be construed as involving an early selection mechanism. However, recent work has argued that task set control might not be needed to explain all of the switching cost in task switching studies. Here we consider whether task conflict plays a role in selective attention tasks. In particular, we consider whether S-R associations, which lead to informational conflict, are enough on their own to explain findings attributed to task set conflict. We review and critically evaluate both the findings that provided the original impetus for proposing task conflict in selective attention tasks and more recent findings reporting negative facilitation (longer RTs to congruent than to neutral stimuli) - a unique marker of task conflict. We then provide a tentative alternative account of negative facilitation based on poor control over informational conflict and apply it to a number of paradigms including the Colour-Object interference and Affordances tasks. It is argued that invoking competition between task sets in selective attention tasks might not be necessary.",

A popular view is that limits in working memory (WM) prevent us from simultaneously maintaining all task relevant information in mind. We therefore chunk the task into smaller units so that we only maintain information in WM that is relevant to the current unit. In contrast to this view, we show that long tasks that are not constrained by WM limits are nonetheless chunked into smaller units. Participants executed long sequences of standalone but demanding trials that were not linked to any WM representation and whose execution was not constrained by how much information could be simultaneously held in WM. Using signs well-known to reflect beginning of new task units, we show that such trial sequences were not executed as a single task unit but were spontaneously chunked and executed as series smaller units. We also found that sequences made of easier trials were executed as longer task units and vice-versa, further suggesting that the length of task executed as one unit may be constrained by cognitive limits <i>other</i> than WM. Cognitive limits are typically seen to constrain how many things can be done <i>simultaneously</i> e.g., how many events can be maintained in WM or attended at the same time. We show a new aspect of these limits that constrains the length of behaviour that can be executed <i>sequentially</i> as a single task-unit.",

We compared toxicity from radiation therapy (RT) to the prostate bed and pelvic lymph nodes (PBPLN-RT) with prostatebed only radiation therapy (PBO-RT) following radical prostatectomy. Methods and Materials Patients with prostate cancer who underwent post-prostatectomy RT between 2010 and 2016 were identified by using the National Prostate Cancer Audit (NPCA) database. Follow-up data was available up to December 31, 2018. Validated outcome measures, based on a framework of procedural and diagnostic codes, were used to capture ≥Grade 2 gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity. An adjusted competing-risks regression analysis estimated subdistribution hazard ratios (sHR). A sHR > 1 indicated a higher incidence of toxicity with PBPLN-RT than with PBO-RT. Results 5-year cumulative incidences in the PBO-RT (n = 5,087) and PBPLNRT (n = 593) groups was 18.2% and 15.9% for GI toxicity, respectively. For GU toxicity it was 19.1% and 20.7%, respectively. There was no evidence of difference in GI or GU toxicity after adjustment between PBO-RT and PBPLN-RT (GI: adjusted sHR, 0.90, 95% CI, 0.67-1.19; P = 0.45); (GU: adjusted sHR, 1.19, 95% CI, 0.99-1.44; P = 0.09). Conclusions This national population-based study found that including PLNs in the radiation field following radical prostatectomy is not associated with a significant increase in rates of ≥Grade 2 GI or GU toxicity at 5 years.",

However, the substrate choice and gloeocystidia and basidiospore sizes of the specimens collected were distinct from other <i>Hericium</i> species. This was confirmed by sequencing the ITS and 28S genetic markers, respectively. The novel species is described as <i>Hericium ophelieae</i> sp. nov. and appears unique as it grows on hardwoods indigenous to Southern Africa. The species has larger basidiospores and wider gloeocystidia compared to its closest relative. <i>H. ophelieae</i> sp. nov. is the first endemic species of the medicinal mushroom genus <i>Hericium</i> to be described from Southern Africa, and the second to be described from Africa, after its closest relative, <i>H. bembedjaense</i>, which was isolated in Cameroon. Although this is the first <i>Hericium</i> to be described from the Southern African region, there are likely others to be discovered, and this study highlights the need for further research into the fungal diversity of Afrotemperate environments.",

This was confirmed by sequencing the ITS and 28S genetic markers, respectively. The novel …",

Fifteen fungal isolates were isolated and identified by molecular methods into the genera <i>Alternaria, Cladosporium, Curvularia, Diaporthe, Epicoccum, Myrothecium, Neofusicoccum, Nigrospora, Preussia</i> and <i>Ustilago. Cladosporium cladosporioides</i> and <i>Curvularia lunata</i> were the most frequently isolated species. The fungal metabolic profiles were obtained by automated TLC and NMR and analysed by PC Analysis. Antifungal and antibacterial activity was assessed by bioautographic assays. In addition, the biotransforming ability of the fungal isolates was tested on <i>F. carica</i> extracts. Five isolates (33.3%) exhibited inhibitory activity against at least one of the microorganisms tested. Most of the fungal endophytes were able to metabolise the flavonoid rutin <b>1</b>, and the coumarin psoralen <b>3</b> present in <i>F. carica</i> extracts. Further investigations of the psoralen biotransforming ability performed by the selected endophyte <i>Alternaria alternata</i> F8 showed the accumulation of the 6,7-furan-hydrocoumaric acid derivative <b>4</b> as the main biotransformation product. Our results corroborate that <i>F. carica</i> can live symbiotically with rich and diverse endophytic communities adding insights about their ecological interactions.",

As a special group of fungi, the NTF are not only excellent model organism for studying lifestyle transition of fungi but also natural resources of exploring biological control of nematodes. However, the carnivorous mechanism of NTF remains poorly understood. Nowadays, the omics studies of NTF have provided numerous genes and pathways that are associated with the phenotypes of carnivorous traits, which need molecular tools to verify. Here, we review the development and progress of gene manipulation tools in NTF, including methodology and strategy of transformation, random gene mutagenesis methods and target gene mutagenesis methods. The principle and practical approach for each method was summarized and discussed, and the basic operational flow for each tool was described. This paper offers a clear reference and instruction for researchers who work on NTF as well as other group of fungi.",

The current case report enlightens the endodontic management of an anomalous maxillary left central incisor with two roots/root canals, a C-shaped root canal configuration in a maxillary left lateral incisor identified by three-dimensional cone-beam computed tomography imaging as well as the successful aesthetic rehabilitation of maxillary fractured incisors. The chief complaint of patient was a history of trauma during his outdoor play and consequent broken upper front teeth. Tooth #9 was diagnosed with pulpal necrosis accompanied by asymptomatic apical periodontitis with two relatively dilacerated roots while the maxillary left lateral incisor (tooth #10) was diagnosed with necrotic pulp and asymptomatic apical periodontitis having a C-shaped canal. Endodontic treatment for teeth #9 and #10 were performed, followed by post and core fabrication. Tooth reinforcement was achieved with prefabricated un-polymerized glass fiber post for lateral incisor and Interlig Fiber for central incisor. Intentional root canal treatment of tooth #8 was considered to reduce labial inclination. The anomalous maxillary central incisor with two roots is an unexpected variant during endodontic treatment, and the presence of C-shaped canal in lateral incisors is extremely rare requiring careful diagnosis with radiographs, clinical examination along with additional aids; <i>e.g.</i> Three-dimensional (3-D) cone-beam computed tomography. 3-D imaging has added the advantages of appropriate identification of anomalous anterior teeth and careful location of additional root canal(s) during endodontic treatment.",

A time consuming and human intensive necessity is the maintenance of high hygiene quality in care homes. Robotic vacuum cleaners have been proven effective for doing the job elsewhere, but-in the context of care homes-are counterproductive for residents' well-being and do not get accepted. This is because people with dementia manifest their agency in more implicit and emotional ways, while making sense of the world around them. Starting from these premises, we explored how a zoomorphic designed vacuum cleaner could better accommodate the sensemaking of people with dementia. Our design reconceptualises robotic vacuum cleaners as a cat-like robot, referring to a playful behaviour and appearance to communicate a non-threatening and familiar role model. Data from an observational study shows that residents responded positively to our prototype, as most of them engaged playfully with it as if it was a pet or a cat-like toy, for example luring it with gestures. Some residents simply ignored the robot, indicating that it was not perceived as frightening or annoying. The level of activity influenced reactions; residents ignored our prototype if busy with other occupations, which proves that it did not cause significant disturbance. We further report results from focus group sessions with formal and informal caregivers who discussed a video prototype of our robot. Caregivers encouraged us to enhance the animal like characteristics (in behaviour and materiality) even further to result in richer interactions and provoke haptic pleasure but also pointed out that residents should not mistake the robot for a real cat.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "Considering the evolution of rotation sensing and timing applications realized in micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), flexural mode resonant shapes are outperformed by bulk acoustic wave (BAW) counterparts by achieving higher frequencies with both electrostatic and piezoelectric transduction. Within the 1-30&#8201;MHz range, which hosts BAW gyroscopes and timing references, piezoelectric and electrostatic MEMS have similar transduction efficiency. Although, when designed intelligently, electrostatic transduction allows self-alignment between electrodes and the resonator for various BAW modes, misalignment is inevitable regarding piezoelectric transduction of BAW modes that require electrode patterning. In this paper transverse piezoelectric actuation of [011] oriented single crystal lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PMN-PT) thin film disks are shown to excite the tangential mode and family of elliptical compound resonant modes, utilizing a self-aligned and unpatterned electrode that spans the entire disk surface. The resonant mode coupling is achieved by employing a unique property of [011] PMN-PT, where the in-plane piezoelectric coefficients have opposite signs. Fabricating 1-port disk transducers, RF reflection measurements are performed that demonstrate the compound mode family shapes in the 1-30&#8201;MHz range. Independent verification of mode transduction is achieved using in-plane displacement measurements with Polytec's laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV). While the tangential mode achieves a 40<sup>o</sup>/s dithering rate at 335&#8201;kHz resonant frequency, the <i>n</i>&#8201;=&#8201;2 wine-glass mode achieves 11.46&#8201;nm tip displacement at 8.42&#8201;MHz resonant frequency on a radius of 60&#8201;&#956;m disk resonator in air. A single electrode resonator that can excite both tangential and wine-glass modes with such metrics lays the foundation for a BAW MEMS gyroscope with a built-in primary calibration stage.",

Of the genotypes, based on their associations with a systemic oxidative stress biomarker, plasma F<sub>2</sub>-isoprostanes (FiP) concentrations, we selected 4 <i>GSTP1</i> SNPs for an AE GRS, and 12 SNPs of 5 genes (<i>XRCC1</i>, <i>TDG</i>, <i>PNKP</i>, <i>MUTYH</i>, and <i>FEN1</i>) for a BER GRS. We also calculated a previously-reported, validated, questionnaire-based, oxidative stress biomarker-weighted oxidative balance score (OBS) comprising 17 anti- and pro-oxidant dietary and lifestyle exposures, with higher scores representing a higher predominance of antioxidant exposures. We used general linear regression to assess adjusted mean FiP concentrations across GRS and OBS tertiles, separately and jointly. <b>Results:</b> The adjusted mean FiP concentrations among those in the highest relative to the lowest oxidative stress-specific AE and BER GRS tertiles were, proportionately, 11.8% (<i>p</i> = 0.12) and 21.2% (<i>p</i> = 0.002) higher, respectively. In the joint AE/BER GRS analysis, the highest estimated mean FiP concentration was among those with jointly high AE/BER GRS.

Recent clinical studies have shown that the proportion of chronic kidney diseases (CKD) in burn patients after discharge is significantly higher than that in the general population, but the mechanism behind this is controversial. The traditional view is that CKD is associated with hypoperfusion, AKI, sepsis, and drugs administered in the early stages of burns. However, recent studies have shown that burns can cause long-term immune dysfunction, which is a high-risk factor for CKD. This suggests that burns affect the kidneys more than previously recognized. In other words, severe burns are not only an acute injury but also a chronic disease. Neglecting to study long-term kidney function in burn patients also results in a lack of preventive and therapeutic methods being developed. Furthermore, stem cells and their exosomes have shown excellent comprehensive therapeutic properties in the prevention and treatment of CKD, making them increasingly the focus of research attention. Their engineering strategy further improved the therapeutic performance. This review will focus on the research advances in burns on the development of CKD, illustrating the possible mechanism of burn-induced CKD and introducing potential biological treatment options and their engineering strategies.",

Ewing's sarcoma is a rare tumor, usually of small dimensions of neuroectodermal origin that is difficult to distinguish pathologically from a primitive neuroectodermal tumor. A 22-year-old female patient with PC 1/3 deficiency was admitted to our clinic with recurrent urinary tract infections. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an 11x12 cm pelvic mass displacing the uterus. A core-needle biopsy was performed on the pelvic mass. As a result of the pathological evaluation, ıt was diagnosed with pelvic Ewing's sarcoma. The patient was started on the VAC-IE chemotherapy protocol.

Second, it shows the effect of social media consumption on climate change awareness by assessing the role of each of the most popular sites: YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Snapchat, and Tumblr. Third, it assesses the effects of multi-platform consumption. The results show that YouTube has the strongest and most robust positive and statistically significant effect on climate change awareness, followed by Instagram, Twitter, and WhatsApp, while being a multi-platform user also has a positive and statistically significant effect on climate change awareness. The implications of these findings for understanding the role of social media in the development of environmental awareness are discussed.",

The most effective method for preventing the spread of the virus currently involves tracking and physically isolating close contacts. In this paper, we propose the Close Contact Identification Algorithm (CCIA). The probability density of user location points may be higher in a certain spatial range such as a cabin where there are more location points. The characteristics of CCIA include using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to calculate the probability density of each user location point and seeking the maximum Euclidean distance between location points in each cluster for merging clusters. CCIA is capable of calculating the probability density of each location point, a feature that other clustering algorithms, such as Kmeans, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN, cannot achieve. The contribution of CCIA is using the probability density of each location point to identify close contacts in ship environments. The performance of CCIA shows more accurate clustering compared to Kmeans, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN. CCIA can effectively identify close contacts and enhance the capabilities of user devices in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 within ship environments.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "The BipA protein is a universally conserved GTPase in bacterial species and is structurally similar to translational GTPases. Despite its wide distribution, BipA is dispensable for growth under optimal growth conditions but is required under stress conditions. In particular, <i>bipA</i>-deleted cells (ESC19) have been shown to display a variety of phenotypic changes in ribosome assembly, capsule production, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis, biofilm formation, and motility at low temperature, suggesting its global regulatory roles in cold adaptation. Here, through genomic library screening, we found a suppressor clone containing <i>nhaR</i>, which encodes a Na<sup>+</sup>-responsive LysR-type transcriptional regulator and whose gene product partially restored the growth of strain ESC19 at 20&#176;C. The suppressed cells showed slightly reduced capsule production and improved biofilm-forming ability at 20&#176;C, whereas the defects in the LPS core and swimming motility were not restored but aggravated by overexpression of <i>nhaR</i>. Notably, the overexpression partially alleviated the defects in 50S ribosomal subunit assembly and rRNA processing of ESC19 cells by enhancing the overall transcription of rRNA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed the association of NhaR with the promoter of seven <i>rrn</i> operons, suggesting that NhaR directly regulates rRNA transcription in ESC19 at 20&#176;C. The suppressive effects of NhaR on ribosomes, capsules, and LPS were dependent on its DNA-binding activity, implying that NhaR might be a transcriptional factor involved in regulating these genes at 20&#176;C. Furthermore, we found that BipA may be involved in adaptation to salt stress, designating BipA as a global stress-responsive regulator, as the deletion of <i>bipA</i> led to growth defects at 37&#176;C and high Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations without ribosomal defects.",

The proteins regulated by eIF3a are still being explored <i>in vivo</i>. In this study, a Cre-loxP system was used to generate eIF3a conditional knockout mice. Tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling with LC-MS/MS analysis was used to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in fat, lungs, skin, and spleen tissue of the eIF3a knockout mice and controls. Bioinformatics analysis was then used to explore the functions and molecular signaling pathways of these protein landscapes. It was observed that eIF3a is essential for life sustenance. Abnormal tissue pathology was found in the lungs, fat, skin, spleen, and thymus. In total, 588, 210, 324, and 944 DEPs were quantified in the lungs, fat, skin, and spleen, respectively, of the eIF3a knockout mice as compared to the control. The quantified differentially expressed proteins were tissue-specific, except for eight proteins shared by the four tissues. A broad range of functions for eIF3a, including cellular signaling pathway, immune response, metabolism, defense response, phagocytes, and DNA replication, has been revealed using bioinformatics analysis. Herein, several pathways related to oxidative stress in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, including nitrogen metabolism, peroxisome, cytochrome P450 drug metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, PPAR signaling pathway, phospholipase D signaling pathway, B-cell receptor signaling pathway, ferroptosis, and focal adhesion, have been identified. Collectively, this study shows that <i>eIF3a</i> is an essential gene for sustaining life, and its downstream proteins are involved in diverse novel functions beyond mRNA translational regulation.",

Inhibition of its essential MurF protein has been proposed as a potential target for broad-spectrum drugs. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of a novel ecological niche of 374 fungus-growing termite associated Natural Products (NPs). The molecular docking and computational pharmacokinetics screened four compounds, i.e., Termstrin B, Fridamycin A, Maduralactomycin A, and Natalenamide C, as potential compounds that have higher binding affinities and favourable protein-ligand interactions. The compound Maduralactomycin A induced more stability based on its lowest average RMSD value (2.31&#160;&#197;) and low standard deviation (0.35) supported by the consistent flexibility and &#946;-factor during the protein's time-dependent motion. While hydrogen bond analysis indicated that Termstrin B has formed the strongest intra-protein interaction, solvent accessibility was in good agreement with Maduralactomycin A compactness. Maduralactomycin A has the strongest binding energy among all the compounds (-348.48&#160;kcal/mol) followed by Termstrin B (-321.19&#160;kcal/mol). Since these findings suggest Maduralactomycin A and Termstrin B as promising candidates for inhibition of MurF protein, the favourable binding energies of Maduralactomycin A make it a more important compound to warrant further investigation. However, experimental validation using animal models and clinical trials is recommended before reaching any final conclusions.",

The crosstalk between cartilage and subchondral bone plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis and progression of OA. Hypoxia has been reported to play an important role in cartilage degradation and subchondral bone remodeling in OA. In this study, we aimed to identify the involvement of hypoxia in modifying the osteoblast phenotypes and determine whether these alterations could influence the metabolism of chondrocytes. <b>Methods:</b> First, the levels of Hif-1&#945; in subchondral bone of different compartments in patients with OA were assessed using immunohistochemistry (IHC). In <i>in vitro</i>, human primary osteoblasts were cultured under hypoxic and normoxic conditions, and the hypoxic or normoxic conditioned media (HCM and NCM) were used to culture human primary chondrocytes. Then, phenotypic changes in osteoblasts were assessed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Furthermore, the expression of type II collagen (COL2A1), aggrecan (ACAN), SRY-related high-mobility group-box gene 9 (SOX9), matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13), and matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3) in chondrocytes was measured using RT-PCR. Finally, the serum levels of Wnt-related proteins were determined using ELISA. <b>Results:</b> Hif-1&#945; was significantly increased in severely sclerotic subchondral bone compared to less damaged subchondral bone. &#946;-Catenin and SOST were identified as upregulated and downregulated in hypoxic osteoblasts, respectively. The hypoxia-induced results were confirmed by ELISA. Stimulating human primary chondrocytes with HCM significantly induced MMP13 and MMP3 and inhibited COL2A1, ACAN, and SOX9 mRNA expression. The serum levels of DKK-1 were significantly increased in human OA. <b>Conclusion:</b> Together, these findings revealed that hypoxia in subchondral bone is a key factor in the crosstalk between chondrocytes and osteoblasts and facilitates the shift of chondrocytes toward an OA-like phenotype probably by activating the Wnt/&#946;-catenin signaling pathway in osteoblasts.",

However, the EHR data are notoriously noisy due to missing and inaccurate inputs despite the information is abundant. One serious problem is that only a small portion of patients in the database has confirmatory diagnoses while many other patients remain undiagnosed because they did not comply with the recommended examinations. The phenomenon leads to a so-called positive-unlabelled situation and the labels are extremely imbalanced. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach to classify the unlabelled patients by using a Bayesian finite mixture model. We also discuss the label switching issue for the imbalanced data and propose a consensus Monte Carlo approach to address the imbalance issue and improve computational efficiency simultaneously. Simulation studies show that our proposed model-based approach outperforms existing positive-unlabelled learning algorithms. The proposed method is applied on the Cerner EHR for detecting diabetic retinopathy (DR) patients using laboratory measurements. With only 3% confirmatory diagnoses in the EHR database, we estimate the actual DR prevalence to be 25% which coincides with reported findings in the medical literature.",

Hepatic fibrosis (HF) is a pathological process of excessive sedimentation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as collagens, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans (PGs) in the hepatic parenchyma. Changes in the composition of the ECM lead to the stiffness of the matrix that destroys its inherent mechanical homeostasis, and a mechanical homeostasis imbalance activates hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) into myofibroblasts, which can overproliferate and secrete large amounts of ECM proteins. Excessive ECM proteins are gradually deposited in the Disse gap, and matrix regeneration fails, which further leads to changes in ECM components and an increase in stiffness, forming a vicious cycle. These processes promote the occurrence and development of hepatic fibrosis. In this review, the dynamic process of ECM remodeling of HF and the activation of HSCs into mechanotransduction signaling pathways for myofibroblasts to participate in HF are discussed. These mechanotransduction signaling pathways may have potential therapeutic targets for repairing or reversing fibrosis.",

The zone 0-5 complete arch chimney thoracic endovascular repair included chimneys that extended from the ascending thoracic aorta to the innominate, left common carotid, and left subclavian arteries and a thoracic stent graft extending from zone 0 to 5. The zone 5-10 aortic reconstructions were staged. Stage 1 included either thoracic stent graft and antegrade four visceral chimney placement or abdominal aortic stent graft and retrograde four visceral chimney placement. Stage II included completion of the remainder of the aortic reconstruction with cerebrospinal fluid drainage. A total of 15 aortic procedures included 34 chimneys (14 aortic arch and 20 visceral). Two patients (40%) underwent zone 0-5 aortic reconstruction first, and three patients (60%) underwent zone 5-10 aortic reconstruction first. The incidence of 30-day mortality, spinal cord ischemia, myocardial infarction, stroke, and visceral ischemia was 0%. At a mean follow-up of 4.5 ± 3.1 years, the aortic reconstruction-related mortality was 0%. All-cause mortality was 20%; one patient had died of pneumonia at 3 years postoperatively. Two endoleaks each occurred in zone 0-5 and zone 5-10 (40% for both groups). All endoleaks were treated with coil embolization.

A challenge in these applications is that mixtures of five or more FAs and FAMEs are isolated from a vegetable oil source, and methods to separate these mixtures are decades old and have increasingly high costs associated with the production of high-purity single-component FAs or FAMEs. We developed a method to separate these mixtures using mixed matrix membranes containing nanometer-sized covalent organic frameworks. The 2D, crystalline COFs possessed narrow distributions of pore sizes of 1.3, 1.8, 2.3, and 3.4 nm that separated FAs and FAMEs based on their degrees of unsaturation. The COFs were synthesized, characterized, and then encapsulated at 10 or 20% by weight into a prepolymer of epoxy that was then fully cured. For all mixed matrix membranes, as the degree of unsaturation increased, the FAs or FAMEs had a slower flux. The largest difference in flux was obtained for a COF/epoxy membrane with a pore size of 1.8 nm, and methyl stearate had a 5.9× faster flux than methyl linolenate. These are the first membranes that can separate the important C18 FAs and FAMEs found in vegetable oil.",

But the clinical outcomes of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) were not ideal because of their poor prognosis, more effective therapeutic approaches are still necessary to further improve this problem. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors lead to the single-strand DNA breaks and/or double-strand DNA breaks, and result in synthetic lethality in cancer cells with impaired homologous recombination genes. It is estimated that approximately 20~25% of patients with mCRPC have a somatic or germinal DNA damage repair gene mutation. Furthermore, in \"<i>BRCA</i>ness\" cases, which has been used to describe as tumors that have not arisen from a germline <i>BRCA1</i> or <i>BRCA2</i> mutation, there were also a number of studies sought to extend these promising results of PARP inhibitors. It is worth noting that an interaction between androgen receptor signaling and synthetic lethality with PARP inhibitors has been proposed. In this review, we discussed the mechanism of action and clinical research of PARP inhibitors, which may benefit population from \"specific\" to the \"all-comer\" in patients with PC when combined with novel hormonal therapies.",

Further, a healthy dietary pattern has been shown to potentially protect against different endometrial dysfunctions and is a potential modulator of metabolomic composition and, consequently, the intrauterine microenvironment. The Mediterranean Diet (MD), characterized by a high intake of fruits, vegetables, cereals, nuts, legumes, fish, and olive oil, and a low consumption of meat, dairy products, and processed foods, has been associated with a wide range of benefits for health. Indeed, the MD pattern has displayed a beneficial role in endometriosis management and fertility; however, the relationship between the MD and the endometrial metabolome is still unknown. In our study, we set out to analyze receptive-phase endometrial metabolome profiles among women with infertility and their associations with MD.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "Glycogen storage type Ib (GSDIb) is a rare inborn error of metabolism caused by glucose-6-phosphate transporter (G6PT, <i>SLC37A4</i>) deficiency. G6PT defect results in excessive accumulation of glycogen and fat in the liver, kidney, and intestinal mucosa and into both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis impairment. Clinical features include hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, lactic acidemia, hyperuricemia, hyperlipidemia, and growth retardation. Long-term complications are liver adenoma, hepatocarcinoma, nephropathy and osteoporosis. The hallmark of GSDIb is neutropenia, with impaired neutrophil function, recurrent infections and inflammatory bowel disease. Alongside classical nutritional therapy with carbohydrates supplementation and immunological therapy with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, the emerging role of 1,5-anhydroglucitol in the pathogenesis of neutrophil dysfunction led to repurpose empagliflozin, an inhibitor of the renal glucose transporter SGLT2: the current literature of its off-label use in GSDIb patients reports beneficial effects on neutrophil dysfunction and its clinical consequences. Surprisingly, this glucose-lowering drug ameliorated the glycemic and metabolic control in GSDIb patients. Furthermore, numerous studies from big cohorts of type 2 diabetes patients showed the efficacy of empagliflozin in reducing the cardiovascular risk, the progression of kidney disease, the NAFLD and the metabolic syndrome. Beneficial effects have also been described on peripheral neuropathy in a prediabetic rat model. Increasing evidences highlight the role of empagliflozin in regulating the cellular energy sensors SIRT1/AMPK and Akt/mTOR, which leads to improvement of mitochondrial structure and function, stimulation of autophagy, decrease of oxidative stress and suppression of inflammation. Modulation of these pathways shift the oxidative metabolism from carbohydrates to lipids oxidation and results crucial in reducing insulin levels, insulin resistance, glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity. For its pleiotropic effects, empagliflozin appears to be a good candidate for drug repurposing also in other metabolic diseases presenting with hypoglycemia, organ damage, mitochondrial dysfunction and defective autophagy.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "Sarcopenia, characterized by a loss of muscle mass and strength with aging, is prevalent in older adults. Although the exact mechanisms underlying sarcopenia are not fully understood, evidence suggests that the loss of mitochondrial integrity in skeletal myocytes has emerged as a pivotal contributor to the complex etiology of sarcopenia. Mitochondria are the primary source of ATP production and are also involved in generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), regulating ion signals, and initiating apoptosis signals in muscle cells. The accumulation of damaged mitochondria due to age-related impairments in any of the mitochondrial quality control (MQC) processes, such as proteostasis, biogenesis, dynamics, and mitophagy, can contribute to the decline in muscle mass and strength associated with aging. Interestingly, a decrease in sex hormones (e.g., 17β-estradiol and testosterone), which occurs with aging, has also been linked to sarcopenia. Indeed, 17β-estradiol and testosterone targeted mitochondria and exhibited activities in regulating mitochondrial functions. Here, we overview the current literature on the key mechanisms by which mitochondrial dysfunction contribute to the development and progression of sarcopenia and the potential modulatory effects of 17β-estradiol and testosterone on mitochondrial function in this context. The advance in its understanding will facilitate the development of potential therapeutic agents to mitigate and manage sarcopenia.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "The prevalence of obesity and diabetes mellitus (DM) has been consistently increasing worldwide. Sharing powerful genetic and environmental features in their pathogenesis, obesity amplifies the impact of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors on DM. The ectopic expansion of adipose tissue and excessive accumulation of certain nutrients and metabolites sabotage the metabolic balance via insulin resistance, dysfunctional autophagy, and microbiome-gut-brain axis, further exacerbating the dysregulation of immunometabolism through low-grade systemic inflammation, leading to an accelerated loss of functional β-cells and gradual elevation of blood glucose. Given these intricate connections, most available treatments of obesity and type 2 DM (T2DM) have a mutual effect on each other. For example, anti-obesity drugs can be anti-diabetic to some extent, and some anti-diabetic medicines, in contrast, have been shown to increase body weight, such as insulin. Meanwhile, surgical procedures, especially bariatric surgery, are more effective for both obesity and T2DM. Besides guaranteeing the availability and accessibility of all the available diagnostic and therapeutic tools, more clinical and experimental investigations on the pathogenesis of these two diseases are warranted to improve the efficacy and safety of the available and newly developed treatments.",

The aim of this article is to summarize results from studies that have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study functional brain alterations in patients with CS. In these studies, alterations in brain areas and networks essential for cognitive function, emotional processing, and executive function have been observed, both in patients with active CS as well as following treatment.

The binding of RANKL, the critical cytokine for osteoclast differentiation, to its receptor in osteoclast precursor cells of the monocyte lineage recruits the adaptor protein TRAF6 and activates multiple signaling pathways. Early effects of RANKL include stimulation of mitochondria. 17&#946;-estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) prevents the effects of RANKL on mitochondria and promotes mitochondria mediated apoptotic cell death. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the actions of RANKL and estrogens on mitochondria remain unknown. Evolutionarily Conserved Signaling Intermediate in Toll Pathway (ECSIT) is a complex I-associated protein that regulates immune responses in macrophages following the engagement of Toll-like receptors, which also recruit TRAF6. Here, we examined whether ECSIT could be implicated in the rapid effects of RANKL and E<sub>2</sub> on osteoclast progenitors.",

Disruption of ER homeostasis leads to beta cell death and diabetes. Among the four components to maintain ER homeostasis, the role of ER export in insulin biogenesis or beta cell survival was not well-understood. COPII (coat protein complex II) dependent transport is a conserved mechanism for most cargo proteins to exit ER and transport to Golgi apparatus. Emerging evidence began to reveal a critical role of COPII-dependent ER export in beta cells. In this review, we will first discuss the basic components of the COPII transport machinery, the regulation of cargo entry and COPII coat assembly in mammalian cells, and the general concept of receptor-mediated cargo sorting in COPII vesicles. On the basis of these general discussions, the current knowledge and recent developments specific to the beta cell COPII dependent ER export are summarized under normal and diabetic conditions.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "Adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance are hallmarks in the development of metabolic diseases resulting from overweight and obesity, such as type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In obesity, adipocytes predominantly secrete proinflammatory adipokines that further promote adipose tissue dysfunction with negative effects on local and systemic insulin sensitivity. Expression of the serpin vaspin (SERPINA12) is also increased in obesity and type 2 diabetes, but exhibits compensatory roles in inflammation and insulin resistance. This has in part been demonstrated using vaspin-transgenic mice. We here report a new mouse line (h-vaspinTG) with transgenic expression of human vaspin in adipose tissue that reaches vaspin concentrations three orders of magnitude higher than wild type controls (&gt;200 ng/ml). Phenotyping under chow and high-fat diet conditions included glucose-tolerance tests, measurements of energy expenditure and circulating parameters, adipose tissue and liver histology. Also, <i>ex vivo</i> glucose uptake in isolated adipocytes and skeletal muscle was analyzed in h-vaspinTG and littermate controls. The results confirmed previous findings, revealing a strong reduction in diet-induced weight gain, fat mass, hyperinsulinemia, -glycemia and -cholesterolemia as well as fatty liver. Insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue and muscle was not altered. The h-vaspinTG mice showed increased energy expenditure under high fat diet conditions, that may explain reduced weight gain and overall metabolic improvements. In conclusion, this novel human vaspin-transgenic mouse line will be a valuable research tool to delineate whole-body, tissue- and cell-specific effects of vaspin in health and disease.",

Among them, depression can dramatically damage patients' quality of life, yet its prevalence in GD has not received adequate attention. Some studies have established a strong correlation between GD and increased risk of depression, though the data from current study remains limited. The summary of mechanistic insights regarding GD and depression has underpinned possible pathways by which GD contributes to depression. In this review, we first summarized the clinical evidence that supported the increased prevalence of depression by GD. We then concentrated on the mechanistic findings related to the acceleration of depression in the context of GD, as mounting evidence has indicated that GD promotes the development of depression through various mechanisms, including triggering autoimmune responses, inducing hormonal disorders, and influencing the thyroid-gut-microbiome-brain axis. Finally, we briefly presented potential therapeutic approaches to decreasing the risk of depression among patients with GD.",

The early clinical symptoms of HCMB may not be significant. Moreover, it is difficult to achieve early diagnosis and intervention for targeted prevention of HICH. Although hypertension (HTN) is a predisposition for HCMB, it remains unclear whether there is any difference between hypertensive patients with or without HCMB. Therefore, we carried out liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to analyze early biomarkers for HCMB in mice with hypertension and to lay the foundation for early prevention of HICH in hypertensive patients. In total, 18 C57 male mice were randomly divided into the HCMB (n = 6), HTN (n = 6), and control groups (CON, n = 6). Hematoxylin-eosin and diaminobenzidine staining were used to assess the reliability of the model. The metabolite expression level and sample category stability were tested using the displacement test of orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Significant differences in metabolites were screened out using variable importance in the projection (VIP &gt; 1), which were determined using the OPLS-DA model and the P-value of the t-test (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) combined with the nonparametric rank-sum test. With an area under the curve (AUC) &gt; 0.85 and a <i>P-</i>value of 0.05, the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to further screen the distinct metabolites of HCMB. Compared with the HTN and CON groups, the HCMB group had significantly higher blood pressure and lower average body weight (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Through untargeted LC-MS analysis, 93 distinct metabolites were identified in the HCMB (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05, VIP &gt; 1) group. Among these potential biomarkers, six significantly decreased and eight significantly increased differential metabolites were found. Meanwhile, we found that the HCMB group had statistically distinct arginine and purine metabolism pathways (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), and citrulline may be the most significant possible biomarker of HCMB (AUC &gt; 0.85, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05).

Treatment for SHPT has changed radically with the advent of calcimimetics; however, parathyroidectomy (PTx) remains one of the most important treatments. For successful PTx, removing all parathyroid glands (PTGs) without complications is essential to prevent persistent or recurrent SHPT. Preoperative imaging studies for the localization of PTGs, such as ultrasonography, computed tomography, and <sup>99m</sup>Tc-Sestamibi scintigraphy, and intraoperative evaluation methods to confirm the removal of all PTGs, including, intraoperative intact parathyroid hormone monitoring and frozen section diagnosis, are useful. Functional and anatomical preservation of the recurrent laryngeal nerves can be confirmed <i>via</i> intraoperative nerve monitoring. Total or subtotal PTx with or without transcervical thymectomy and autotransplantation can also be performed. Appropriate operative methods for PTx should be selected according to the patients' need for kidney transplantation. In the case of persistent or recurrent SHPT after the initial PTx, localization of the causative PTGs with autotransplantation is challenging as causative PTGs can exist in the neck, mediastinum, or autotransplanted areas. Additionally, the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of calcimimetics and PTx are increasingly being discussed. In this review, medical and surgical treatments for SHPT are described.",

From these relations, we formulate the magnetostatic problem, which is often treated as a vector field problem, as a scalar field problem in which a two-dimensional scalar field (stream function) is related to a three-dimensional one (magnetic scalar potential) via the differentiation of the electrostatic Green's function 1/|r-r<sub>s</sub>|. It is shown that, in a coordinate system in which a separated form of the Green's function exists (separable coordinate system), there exists a simple relationship between a harmonic component of a stream function and a harmonic component of the magnetic scalar potential. The method is applied to calculate idealized surface current patterns for actively shielded, linear gradient field coils in the Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates.",

However, no comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of NALCN has been conducted. Our study aims to explore the potential diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic value of NALCN in human cancers. <b>Methods:</b> Through comprehensive application of datasets from Human Protein Atlas (HPA), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), Enhanced Version of Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER2.0), Tumor and Immune System Interaction Database (TISIDB), The University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer data analysis Portal (UALCAN), cBioPortal, GeneMANIA and Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interaction Gene/Proteins (STRING) databases, we explored the potential roles of NALCN in different cancers. The differential expression, prognostic implications, pathological stages and grades, molecular and immune subtypes, diagnostic accuracy, tumor mutation burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), mismatch repair (MMR) genes, immune checkpoint genes, chemokine genes, major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-related genes, tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs), promoter methylation, mutations, copy number alteration (CNA), and functional enrichment related to NALCN were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> Most cancers lowly expressed NALCN. Upregulated NALCN expression was associated with poor or better prognosis in different cancers. Moreover, NALCN was correlated with clinicopathological features in multiple cancers. NALCN showed high diagnostic accuracy in 5 caner types. NALCN is highly linked with immune-related biomarkers, immune-related genes and TIICs. Significant methylation changes and genetic alteration of NALCN can be observed in many cancers. Enrichment analysis showed that NALCN is closely related to multiple tumor-related signaling pathways. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our study revealed the vital involvement of NALCN in cancer. NALCN can be used as a prognostic biomarker for immune infiltration and clinical outcomes, and has potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "<b>Introduction:</b> The function, origin and structural features of circulating nuclear DNA (cir-nDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (cir-mtDNA) are poorly known, even though they have been investigated in numerous clinical studies, and are involved in a number of routine clinical applications. Based on our previous report disproving the conventional plasma isolation used for cirDNA analysis, this work enables a direct topological comparison of the circulating structures associated with nuclear DNA and mitochondrial cell-free DNA. <b>Materials and methods:</b> We used a Q-PCR and low-pass whole genome sequencing (LP-WGS) combination approach of cir-nDNA and cir-mtDNA, extracted using a procedure that eliminates platelet activation during the plasma isolation process to prevent mitochondria release in the extracellular milieu. Various physical procedures, such as filtration and differential centrifugation, were employed to infer their circulating structures. <b>Results:</b> DSP-S cir-mtDNA mean size profiles distributed on a slightly shorter range than SSP-S. SSP-S detected 40-fold more low-sized cir-mtDNA fragments (&lt;90&#160;bp/nt) and three-fold less long-sized fragments (&gt;200&#160;bp/nt) than DSP-S. The ratio of the fragment number below 90&#160;bp over the fragment number above 200&#160;bp was very homogenous among both DSP-S and SSP-S profiles, being 134-fold lower with DSP-S than with SSP-S. Cir-mtDNA and cir-nDNA DSP-S and SSP-S mean size profiles of healthy individuals ranged in different intervals with periodic sub-peaks only detectable with cir-nDNA. The very low amount of cir-mtDNA fragments of short size observed suggested that most of the cir-mtDNA is poorly fragmented and appearing longer than &#8764;1,000&#160;bp, the readout limit of this LP-WGS method. Data suggested that cir-nDNA is, among DNA extracted in plasma, associated with &#8764;8.6% of large structures (apoptotic bodies, large extracellular vesicles (EVs), cell debris&#8230;), &#8764;27.7% in chromatin and small EVs and &#8764;63.7% mainly in oligo- and mono-nucleosomes. By contrast, cir-mtDNA appeared to be preponderantly (75.7%) associated with extracellular mitochondria, either in its free form or with large EVs; to a lesser extent, it was also associated with other structures: small EVs (&#8764;18.4%), and exosomes or protein complexes (&#8764;5.9%). <b>Conclusion:</b> This is the first study to directly compare the structural features of cir-nDNA and cir-mtDNA. The significant differences revealed between both are due to the DNA topological structure contained in the nucleus (chromatin) and in the mitochondria (plasmid) that determine their biological stability in blood. Although cir-nDNA and cir-mtDNA are principally associated with mono-nucleosomes and cell-free mitochondria, our study highlights the diversity of the circulating structures associated with cell-free DNA. They consequently have different pharmacokinetics as well as physiological functions. Thus, any accurate evaluation of their biological or diagnostic individual properties must relies on appropriate pre-analytics, and optimally on the isolation or enrichment of one category of their cirDNA associated structures.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Pancreatic cancer is one of the most deadly malignancies in the world. It is characterized by rapid progression and a very poor prognosis. The five-year survival rate of pancreatic cancer in China is only 7.2%, which is the lowest among all cancers and the use of combined paclitaxel albumin, capecitabine, and digital has been the clinical standard treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer since 1997. Also, the application of multidrug combinations is often limited by the toxicity of chemotherapy. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a more appropriate and less toxic treatment modality for pancreatic cancer. <b>Case presentation:</b> The patient was a 79-year-old woman, admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer (T3N0M0, stage IIA), with its imaging showing overgrowth of SMV involvement and unresectable reconstruction of the posterior vein after evaluation. As the patient refused chemotherapy, lenvatinib (8&#160;mg/time, qd) and icaritin soft capsules (three tablets/time, bid) were recommended according to our past experience and a few clinical research cases. The tumor lesion was greatly reduced by 57.5% after the treatment, and the extent of vascular involvement also decreased. The aforementioned medication resulted in a significant downstaging of the patient's tumor. <b>Conclusion:</b> Better results were achieved in the treatment with icaritin soft capsules and lenvatinib in this case. Because of its less toxic effect on the liver and kidney and bone marrow suppression, it was suitable to combine icaritin soft capsules with targeted drugs for treating intermediate and advanced malignancies, which brings hope to patients who cannot or refuse to take chemotherapy.",

This was done for analyzing the overall distribution of the MTHFR C677T allele and the geographical distribution of pregnancy complications. <b>Results:</b> A total of 126 studies were included, covering five autonomous areas, four municipalities directly under the Central Government, as well as 22 provinces (except Taiwan Province) in China. MTHFR C677T polymorphism data of 27 groups of Chinese Han women and 31 groups of other Chinese females were obtained, and the chi-square test revealed notable inter-group differences (<i>p</i> = 0.000). The TT genotype and T allele of MTHFR C677T accounted for 18.2% (4.7%-38.3%) and 40.3% (19.7%-61.4%) of the Chinese female population, respectively, with a significant north-south difference. Chinese females had a consistent frequency of the T allele with the geographical distribution of pregnancy complications such as recurrent abortion and preeclampsia. <b>Conclusion:</b> With a obvious geographical gradient, the MTHFR C677T polymorphism distribution in Chinese females is consistent with the geographical distribution of multiple pregnancy complications, and the risk assessment for it might be included in primary prevention for birth defects.",

        "original_csv_abstract": "Cancer remains a formidable challenge in medicine due to its propensity for recurrence and metastasis, which can result in unfavorable treatment outcomes. This challenge is particularly acute for early-stage patients, who may experience recurrence and metastasis without timely detection. Here, we first analyzed the differences in clinical characteristics among the primary tumor, recurrent tumor, and metastatic tumor in different stages of cancer, which may be caused by the molecular level. Moreover, the importance of predicting early cancer recurrence and metastasis is emphasized by survival analyses. Next, we used a multi-omics approach to identify key molecular changes associated with early cancer recurrence and metastasis and discovered that early metastasis in cancer demonstrated a high degree of genomic and cellular heterogeneity. We performed statistical comparisons for each level of omics data including gene expression, mutation, copy number variation, immune cell infiltration, and cell status. Then, various analytical techniques, such as proportional hazard model and Fisher's exact test, were used to identify specific genes or immune characteristics associated with early cancer recurrence and metastasis. For example, we observed that the overexpression of BPIFB1 and high initial B-cell infiltration levels are linked to early cancer recurrence, while the overexpression or amplification of ANKRD22 and LIPM, mutation of IGHA1 and MUC16, high fibroblast infiltration level, M1 polarization of macrophages, cellular status of DNA repair are all linked to early cancer metastasis. These findings have led us to construct classifiers, and the average area under the curve (AUC) of these classifiers was greater than 0.75 in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cancer patients, confirming that the features we identified could be biomarkers for predicting recurrence and metastasis of early cancer. Finally, we identified specific early sensitive targets for targeted therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Once the biomarkers we identified changed, treatment-sensitive targets can be treated accordingly. Our study has comprehensively characterized the multi-omics characteristics and identified a panel of biomarkers of early cancer recurrence and metastasis. Overall, it provides a valuable resource for cancer recurrence and metastasis research and improves our understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving early cancer recurrence and metastasis.",
