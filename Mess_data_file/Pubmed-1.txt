  CSV Title: Pediatric diffuse midline glioma: Understanding the mechanisms and assessing the next generation of personalized therapeutics.
  CSV Abstract: Diffuse midline glioma (DMG) is a pediatric cancer that originates in the midline structures of the brain. Prognosis of DMG patients remains poor due to the infiltrative nature of these tumors and the protection they receive from systemically delivered therapeutics via an intact blood-brain barrier (BBB), making treatment difficult. While the cell of origin remains disputed, it is believed to reside in the ventral pons. Recent research has pointed toward epigenetic dysregulation inducing an OPC-like transcriptomic signature in DMG cells. This epigenetic dysregulation is typically caused by a mutation (K27M) in one of two histone genes-<i>H3F3A</i> or <i>HIST1H3B</i> -and can lead to a differentiation block that increases these cells oncogenic potential. Standard treatment with radiation is not sufficient at overcoming the aggressivity of this cancer and only confers a survival benefit of a few months, and thus, discovery of new therapeutics is of utmost importance. In this review, we discuss the cell of origin of DMGs, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms that contribute to their aggressivity and resistance to treatment. Additionally, we outline the current standard of care for DMG patients and the potential future therapeutics for this cancer that are currently being tested in preclinical and clinical trials.

  CSV Title: Humanistic nursing tailored to the needs of young men with cancer.
  CSV Abstract: The goal of this study is to describe and understand humanistic nursing that is tailored to the needs of young men (18-39 years) with cancer. Eight young men with cancer (n = 8, average age = 28 years) were interviewed individually. Two themes emerged from the interviews: (1) trust between nurse and patient is paramount; and (2) this patient population has needs that are not currently being met through the humanistic nursing approach. The results of the iterative qualitative analysis of the data suggest that humanistic nursing tailored to young men with cancer should address their need to express their feelings, to be active and to receive psychological support.
