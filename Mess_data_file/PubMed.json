There are particular advantages for older individuals in terms of elective surgery, timely transplantation, and early graft function. Yet, despite the superiority of living donor transplantation especially for this cohort, older patients are significantly less likely to access this treatment modality than younger age groups. However, given the changing population demographic in recent decades, there are increasing numbers of older but otherwise healthy individuals with kidney disease who could benefit from living donor transplantation. The complex reasons for this inequity of access are explored, including conscious and unconscious age-related bias by healthcare professionals, concerns relating to older living donors, ethical anxieties related to younger adults donating to aging patients, unwillingness of potential older recipients to consider living donation, and the relevant legislation. There is a legal and moral duty to consider the inequity of access to living donor transplantation, recognising both the potential disparity between chronological and physiological age in older patients, and benefits of this treatment for individuals as well as society.",

In <i>in vitro</i> cell experiments, BIBF1120 did not change cellular activity under normal conditions, while it further suppressed the tube formation, migration, and proliferation of high glucose-induced human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs). Additionally, BIBF1120 blocked the phosphorylation of p38, JNK, and ERK1/2 in high glucose-treating HRMECs.

Copper induces an excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in hair cells, leading to the development of various antioxidants. <b>Methods and results:</b> This study aimed to evaluate the potential antioxidant properties of curcumin (CUR) in the inner ear organ of corti-1 cells (OC1) and animal models (zebrafish and guinea pigs). Graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs) enabled CUR to penetrate the round window membrane (RWM) and maintain the concentration in the perilymph after inner ear administration. The results showed that CUR/GOQDs had favorable biocompatibility and strongly affected ROS generation induced by CIS in OC1 cells. DCFHDA Green staining demonstrated that CUR/GOQDs successfully reversed the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential induced by CIS <i>in vitro</i> and rescued cells from early cuproptosis, which was confirmed by FDX1 staining. Additionally, the experiment found that CUR decreased the expression of cuproptosis proteins (FDX1, LIAS, and LIPT1) and increased the expression of the Bcl-2 protein. <b>Conclusion:</b> The results demonstrate that CUR/GOQDs is a promising therapeutic agent that can prevent CIS-induced ototoxicity by blocking the cuproptosis signal pathway.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "Replacing traditional substrates in industrial bioprocesses to advance the sustainable production of chemicals is an urgent need in the context of the circular economy. However, since the limited degradability of non-conventional carbon sources often returns lower yields, effective exploitation of such substrates requires a multi-layer optimization which includes not only the provision of a suitable feedstock but the use of highly robust and metabolically versatile microbial biocatalysts. We tackled this challenge by means of systems metabolic engineering and validated <i>Escherichia coli</i> W as a promising cell factory for the production of the key building block chemical 2-ketoisovalerate (2-KIV) using whey as carbon source, a widely available and low-cost agro-industrial waste. First, we assessed the growth performance of <i>Escherichia coli</i> W on mono and disaccharides and demonstrated that using whey as carbon source enhances it significantly. Second, we searched the available literature and used metabolic modeling approaches to scrutinize the metabolic space of <i>E. coli</i> and explore its potential for overproduction of 2-KIV identifying as basic strategies the block of pyruvate depletion and the modulation of NAD/NADP ratio. We then used our model predictions to construct a suitable microbial chassis capable of overproducing 2-KIV with minimal genetic perturbations, i.e., deleting the pyruvate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase. Finally, we used modular cloning to construct a synthetic 2-KIV pathway that was not sensitive to negative feedback, which effectively resulted in a rerouting of pyruvate towards 2-KIV. The resulting strain shows titers of up to 3.22 &#177; 0.07&#160;g/L of 2-KIV and 1.40 &#177; 0.04&#160;g/L of L-valine in 24&#160;h using whey in batch cultures. Additionally, we obtained yields of up to 0.81&#160;g 2-KIV/g substrate. The optimal microbial chassis we present here has minimal genetic modifications and is free of nutritional autotrophies to deliver high 2-KIV production rates using whey as a non-conventional substrate.",

Recently, genetic approaches to vector control have shown promise; however, the tools and methods for manipulating the mosquito genome are rather limited. While CRISPR-Cas9 system has been adapted for gene editing purposes in <i>Aedes</i> mosquito, the dCas9-based transcription control of genes remain unexplored.

    "original_csv_abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is widely used for cancer treatment due to its non-invasive and precise effectiveness, however, hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment greatly limits the efficacy of photodynamic therapy. Compared with conventional photosensitizers, carbon dots (CDs) have great potential. Therefore, developing a water-soluble, low-toxicity photosensitizer based on CDs is particularly important, especially one that can enhance the photodynamic efficacy using the tumor microenvironment to produce oxygen. Herein, manganese-doped carbon dot (Mn-CDs, &#8764;2.7&#160;nm) nanoenzymes with excellent biocompatibility were prepared by a solvothermal method using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid manganese disodium salt hydrate and o-phenylenediamine as precursors. TEM, AFM, HR-TEM, XRD, XPS, FT-IR, &#950; potential, DLS, UV-Vis, and PL spectra were used to characterize the Mn-CDs. Cancer resistance was assessed using the CCK-8 kit, calcein AM versus propidium iodide (PI) kit, and the Annexin V-FITC/PI cell apoptosis assay kit. The obtained Mn-CDs have excellent near-infrared emission properties, stability, and efficient <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> generation. Notably, the manganese doping renders CDs with catalase (CAT)-like activity, which leads to the decomposition of acidic H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> <i>in situ</i> to generate O<sub>2</sub>, enhancing the PDT efficacy against OSCC-9 cells under 635&#160;nm (300&#160;mW&#183;cm<sup>-2</sup>) irradiation. Thus, this work provides a simple and feasible method for the development of water-soluble photosensitizers with oxygen production, presenting good biosafety for PDT in hypoxic tumors.",

The treatments available today are either ineffective or have adverse effects. The dysregulation of B cell activation is crucial for the emergence of SLE. MiR-7 explicitly targeted PTEN mRNA in B cells. Treatment with antagomiR-7 reduced B cell hyperresponsiveness and prevented the onset of lupus. As a result, inhibiting miR-7 may be used therapeutically to treat SLE. We developed a SA (sialic acid)-poly (D, L-lactide-co-glycolide) (SA-PLGA) nano delivery system to deliver antagomiR-7 into splenic B cells since the stability and targeted delivery of miRNA remain significant challenges <i>in vivo</i>. Results show that SA-PLGA nanoparticles (SA-PLGA@antagomiR-7) loaded with antagomiR-7 display good biocompatibility and shield antagomiR-7 from degradation, extending the miRNA's duration in circulation <i>in vivo</i>. Additionally, in MRL/Ipr lupus mice, SA-PLGA@antagomiR-7 is successfully delivered to the splenic B cells and preferentially enriched in the diseased spleen in MRL/Ipr lupus mice. The SA-PLGA@antagomiR-7 NPs therapy effectively decreases immunological abnormalities, normalizes splenic B cell subtypes, and suppresses B cell activation. The antagomiR-7 NPs exhibit excellent therapeutic efficiency and high biosafety collectively, which may result in a more effective treatment for SLE.",

Condensed tannins were extracted from industrial bark of Norway spruce by using pressurized hot water extraction (PHWE), followed by purification of extracts by using XADHP7 treatment to obtain sugar-free extract. The chemical composition of the extracts was analyzed by using HPLC, GC&#8210;MS and UHPLC after thiolytic degradation. The test matrices, i.e., lignocellulosic handsheets, were produced and impregnated with tannin-rich extracts, and tannic acid was used as a commercial reference. The antibacterial and antiviral efficacy of the handsheets were analyzed by using bioluminescent bacterial strains (<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> RN4220+pAT19 and <i>Escherichia coli</i> K12+pCGLS11) and Enterovirus coxsackievirus B3. Potential bonding of the tannin-rich extract and tannic acid within the fiber matrices was studied by using FTIR-ATR spectroscopy. The deposition characteristics (distribution and accumulation patterns) of tannin compounds and extracts within fiber networks were measured and visualized by direct chemical mapping using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) and digital microscopy. Our results demonstrated for the first time, how tannin-rich extracts obtained from spruce bark side streams with green chemistry possess antiviral and antibacterial properties when immobilized into fiber matrices to create substitutes for plastic hygienic products, personal protection materials such as surgical face masks, or food packaging materials to prolong the shelf life of foodstuffs and prevent the spread of infections. However, more research is needed to further develop this proof-of-concept to ensure stable chemical bonding in product prototypes with specific chemistry.",

In an attempt to overcome some obstacles with cellulose II cell scaffolding materials related to insufficient biomineralization, lack of micron-size porosity, and deficiency in surface charge, respective solutions have been proposed. These included covalent phosphorylation of different cellulose materials targeting relatively low degrees of substitution (DS 0.18-0.23) and processing these cellulose derivatives into scaffolding materials by a dissolution/coagulation approach employing the hitherto rarely used TBAF/DMSO/H<sub>2</sub>O system for cellulose dissolution. Here, we report bioactivity and preliminary hemocompatibility testing of dual-porous cellulose phosphate aerogels (contrasted with the phosphate-free reference) obtained via coagulation (water/ethanol), solvent exchange and scCO<sub>2</sub> drying. Deposition of hydroxyapatite from simulated body fluid (7 days of immersion) revealed good bioactivity (1.5-2.2&#160;mg Ca<sup>2+</sup> per mg scaffold). Incubation of the scCO<sub>2</sub>-dried and rehydrated scaffolding materials in heparin anticoagulated human whole blood was conducted to study selected parameters of hemostasis (prothrombin F1+2 fragment, PF4, count of thrombocyte-leukocyte conjugates) and inflammatory response (C5a fragment, leukocyte activation marker CD11b). Adhesion of leukocytes on the surface of the incubated substrates was assessed by scanning electron and fluorescence microscopy (DAPI staining). The results suggest that phosphorylation at low DS does not increase platelet activation. However, a significant increase in platelet activation and thrombin formation was observed after a certain fraction of the negative surface charges had been compensated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions. The combination of both phosphorylation and calcification turned out to be a potent means for controlling the inflammatory response, which was close to baseline level for some of the studied samples.",

Near-infrared-II (900-1700&#160;nm, NIR-II) fluorescence microscopic imaging (NIR-II-FMI) has shown great potential for biomedical detection. A novel type of negative target imaging method based on NIR-II-FMI with the assistance of indocyanine green (ICG) was explored. Then, NIR-II-FMI was applied to the early detection of HAE for the first time. The negative targeting NIR-II fluorescence imaging of HAE-infected mice at different stages with the assistance of ICG under 808&#160;nm of laser irradiation was obtained. Especially, HAE microlesions at the early stage were detected clearly. Moreover, clear intrahepatic angiography was achieved under the same NIR-II-FMI system.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "<b>Introduction:</b> In an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), various types of graft materials including autograft, allograft, and synthetic graft have been used to achieve adequate spinal fusion. Allograft spacer is mainly used in cervical fusion, especially in the anterior approach. The synthetic bone graft material BGS-7(CaO-SiO2-P2O5-B2O3, bioactive Glass-Ceramics) can bind with surrounding bone tissue by forming a hydroxyapatite layer bone bridge, leading to faster graft osseointegration. This study was conducted to compare long-term clinical outcome of BGS-7 spacer and allograft spacer for anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> From September 2014 to December 2016, Consecutive anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgeries using a BGS-7 spacer (N = 18) and Allograft spacer (N = 26) were compared for postoperative clinical outcomes. Radiologic assessments were performed, and Instrumental failure, including breakage, cage migration, subsidence were observed and Fusion status were analyzed. Finite element analysis was performed for simulating mechanical stress between the vertebral body and implant. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using neck VAS, NDI, and JOA on the patient's final follow-up visits. <b>Results:</b> Among the 44 patients who underwent an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery using the BGS-7 spacer and Allograft spacer, there were 30 men and 14 women. The average age at the operation was 47.69 &#177; 10.49 in allograft spacer and 51.67 &#177; 11.03 in BGS-7 spacer. The mean follow-up period was 89.18 &#177; 5.44&#160;months. Twenty three (88.46%) patients in allograft spacer and 20(100%) patients in BGS-7 spacer were demonstrated radiologic evidence of interbody fusion in last OPD, which accounts for fusion grade 4 or 5. Peak stresses were 343.85&#160;MPa in allograft spacer, and 132.55&#160;MPa in BGS-7 spacer. Long-term clinical outcomes including neck VAS, NDI, and JOA didn't show statistical differences between the two groups. There were no adverse events related to the BGS-7 spacer.10.3389/fbioe.2023.110046. <b>Conclusion:</b> The BGS-7 spacer demonstrated reliability as a spacer in anterior cervical discectomy and fusionF surgery without instrumental failure. Early stabilization with a bony bridge formation was observed at the intermediate follow-up period, and the long-term clinical outcome was favorable at more than 60&#160;months after surgery without any adverse events. Thus, the BGS-7 spacer is a safe and effective alternative to the allograft spacer in anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery.",

However, the limited amount of native dental pulp tissue restricts its clinical applications. The submandibular gland shares some basic extracellular matrix components and characteristics with dental pulp. However, whether decellularized submandibular gland extracellular matrix (DSMG) can be used as an alternative scaffold for dental pulp regenerative medicine is unclear. <b>Methods:</b> Thus, we successfully decellularized the whole rat submandibular gland and human dental pulp, and then conducted <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies to compare the properties of these two scaffolds for dental pulp regeneration. <b>Results:</b> Our results showed that extracellular matrix of the submandibular gland had great similarities in structure and composition with that of dental pulp. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the DSMG could support adhesion and proliferation of dental pulp stem cells <i>in vitro</i>. <i>In vivo</i> findings revealed that implanted cell-seeded DSMG formed a vascularized dental pulp-like tissue and expressed markers involved in dentinogenesis and angiogenesis. <b>Discussion:</b> In summary, we introduced a novel accessible biological scaffold and validated its effectiveness as an extracellular matrix-based tissue engineering scaffold for dental pulp regenerative therapy.",

Studies of cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and cell-cell interactions can help scientists understand the mysteries of living systems. However, there is considerable heterogeneity among cells. Great differences between individuals can be found even within the same cell cluster. Cell heterogeneity can only be clearly expressed and distinguished at the level of single cells. The development of droplet microfluidics technology opens up a new chapter for single-cell analysis. Microfluidic chips can produce many nanoscale monodisperse droplets, which can be used as small isolated micro-laboratories for various high-throughput, precise single-cell analyses. Moreover, gel droplets with good biocompatibility can be used in single-cell cultures and coupled with biomolecules for various downstream analyses of cellular metabolites. The droplets are also maneuverable; through physical and chemical forces, droplets can be divided, fused, and sorted to realize single-cell screening and other related studies. This review describes the channel design, droplet generation, and control technology of droplet microfluidics and gives a detailed overview of the application of droplet microfluidics in single-cell culture, single-cell screening, single-cell detection, and other aspects. Moreover, we provide a recent review of the application of droplet microfluidics in tumor single-cell immunoassays, describe in detail the advantages of microfluidics in tumor research, and predict the development of droplet microfluidics at the single-cell level.",

Meanwhile, how to implement data security in the DNA storage system is still an unsolved problem. <b>Methods:</b> In this article, we propose an image encryption method based on the modulation-based storage architecture. The key idea is to take advantage of the unpredictable modulation signals to encrypt images in highly error-prone DNA storage channels. <b>Results and Discussion:</b> Numerical results have demonstrated that our image encryption method is feasible and effective with excellent security against various attacks (statistical, differential, noise, and data loss). When compared with other methods such as the hybridization reactions of DNA molecules, the proposed method is more reliable and feasible for large-scale applications.",

The current study focuses on zinc oxide nanoparticles' (ZnO NPs) simple production, characterization, and applications in several fields, including medicinal and photocatalytic degradation of dyes. The non-aqueous-based reflux method is helpful for ZnO NP synthesis; the procedure involves refluxing zinc acetate dihydrate precursor in ethylene glycol for 3 hours in the absence of sodium acetate, in which the refluxing rate and the cooling rate are optimized to get the desired phase, and the unique morphology of polyol-mediated ZnO NPs; it has been achieved using the capping agent TBAB (tetra-butyl ammonium bromide) and precursor zinc acetate dihydrate. UV-Vis, FTIR, XRD, and FESEM structurally characterized polyol-mediated ZnO-NPs. The results show that the material is pure and broadly aggregated into spherical nanoparticles with an average particle size of 18.09 nm. According to XRD analysis, heat annealing made the crystallites more prominent and favored a monocrystalline state. These results and the low cost of making polyol-mediated ZnO NPs demonstrate photocatalytic and antimicrobial properties.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "This work presents the history of the recognition of principal regulatory capacities of estrogen hormones having been mistakenly regarded as breast cancer promoting agents for more than 120&#160;years. Comprehensive analysis of the results of clinical, epidemiological, immunological and molecular studies justified that endogenous estrogens are the principal regulators of embryonic development, survival and reproduction <i>via</i> orchestrating appropriate expression and even edition of all genes in mammalians. Medical use of chemically modified synthetic estrogens caused toxic complications; thromboembolic events and increased cancer risk in female organs as they proved to be endocrine disruptors deregulating estrogen receptors (ERs) rather than their activators. Synthetic estrogen treatment exhibits ambiguous correlations with cancer risk at different sites, which may be attributed to an inhibition of the unliganded activation of estrogen receptors (ERs) coupled with compensatory liganded activation. The principle of estrogen induced breast cancer led to the introduction of antiestrogen therapies against this tumor; inhibition of the liganded activation of estrogen receptors and aromatase enzyme activity. The initial enthusiasm turned into disappointment as the majority of breast cancers proved to be primarily resistant to antiestrogens. In addition, nearly all patients showing earlier good tumor responses to endocrine therapy, later experienced secondary resistance leading to metastatic disease and fatal outcome. Studying the molecular events in tumors responsive and unresponsive to antiestrogen therapy, it was illuminated that a complete inhibition of liganded ER activation stimulates the growth of cancers, while a successful compensatory upregulation of estrogen signal may achieve DNA restoration, tumor regression and patient's survival. Recognition of the principal role of endogenous estrogens in gene expression, gene edition and DNA repair, estrogen treatment and stimulation of ER expression in patients may bring about a great turn in medical practice.",

The first committed step for chlorophyll biosynthesis is insertion of magnesium into protoporphyrin IX by magnesium chelatase. Magnesium chelatase is composed of H-, I-, and D-subunits, with the tetrapyrrole substrate binding to the H-subunit. This subunit is rapidly inactivated in the presence of substrate, light, and oxygen, so oxygenic photosynthetic organisms require mechanisms to protect magnesium chelatase from similar loss of function. An additional protein, GUN4, binds to the H-subunit and to tetrapyrroles. GUN4 has been proposed to serve this protective role via its ability to bind linear tetrapyrroles (bilins). In the current work, we probe the origins of bilin binding by GUN4 via comparative phylogenetic analysis and biochemical validation of a conserved bilin-binding motif. Based on our results, we propose that bilin-binding GUN4 proteins arose early in cyanobacterial evolution and that this early acquisition represents an ancient adaptation for maintaining chlorophyll biosynthesis in the presence of light and oxygen.",

Here, we describe a tadpole optic nerve crush (ONC) procedure and assessments of brain reinnervation based on live imaging of RGC-specific transgenes which, when paired with CRISPR/Cas9 injections at the one-cell stage, can be used to assess the function of regeneration-associated genes in vivo in F0 animals. Using this assay, we find that map3k12, also known as dual leucine zipper kinase (Dlk), is necessary for RGC axonal regeneration and acts in a dose-dependent manner. Loss of Dlk does not affect RGC innervation of the brain during development or visually driven behavior but does block both axonal regeneration and functional vision restoration after ONC. Dlk loss does not alter the acute changes in mitochondrial movement that occur within RGC axons hours after ONC but does completely block the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor Jun within RGCs days after ONC; yet, Jun is dispensable for reinnervation. These results demonstrate that in a species fully capable of regenerating its RGC axons, Dlk is essential for the axonal injury signal to reach the nucleus but may affect regeneration through a different pathway than by which it signals in mammalian RGCs.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "Although cyanobacteria do not possess bacterial triacylglycerol (TAG)-synthesizing enzymes, the accumulation of TAGs and/or lipid droplets has been repeatedly reported in a wide range of species. In most cases, the identification of TAG has been based on the detection of the spot showing the mobility similar to the TAG standard in thin-layer chromatography (TLC) of neutral lipids. In this study, we identified monoacyl plastoquinol (acyl PQH) as the predominant molecular species in the TAG-like spot from the unicellular <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 (<i>S</i>.6803) as well as the filamentous <i>Nostocales</i> sp., <i>Nostoc punctiforme</i> PCC 73102, and <i>Anabaena</i> sp. PCC 7120. In <i>S</i>.6803, the accumulation level of acyl PQH but not TAG was affected by deletion or overexpression of <i>slr2103</i>, indicating that acyl PQH is the physiological product of Slr2103 having homology with the eukaryotic diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2 (DGAT2). Electron microscopy revealed that cyanobacterial strains used in this study do not accumulate lipid droplet structures such as those observed in oleaginous microorganisms. Instead, they accumulate polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) granules and/or aggregates of alkane, free C16 and C18 saturated fatty acids, and low amounts of TAG in the cytoplasmic area, which can be detected by staining with a fluorescent dye specific to neutral lipids. Unlike these lipophilic materials, acyl PQH is exclusively localized in the membrane fraction. There must be DGAT2-like enzymatic activity esterifying de novo-synthesized C16 and C18 fatty acids to PQH<sub>2</sub> in the thylakoid membranes.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "In the Arctic, new particle formation (NPF) and subsequent growth processes are the keys to produce Aitken-mode particles, which under certain conditions can act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCNs). The activation of Aitken-mode particles increases the CCN budget of Arctic low-level clouds and, accordingly, affects Arctic climate forcing. However, the growth mechanism of Aitken-mode particles from NPF into CCN range in the summertime Arctic boundary layer remains a subject of current research. In this combined Arctic cruise field and modeling study, we investigated Aitken-mode particle growth to sizes above 80&#8197;nm. A mechanism is suggested that explains how Aitken-mode particles can become CCN without requiring high water vapor supersaturation. Model simulations suggest the formation of semivolatile compounds, such as methanesulfonic acid (MSA) in fog droplets. When the fog droplets evaporate, these compounds repartition from CCNs into the gas phase and into the condensed phase of nonactivated Aitken-mode particles. For MSA, a mass increase factor of 18 is modeled. The postfog redistribution mechanism of semivolatile acidic and basic compounds could explain the observed growth of &gt;20&#8197;nm h<sup>-1</sup> for 60-nm particles to sizes above 100&#8197;nm. Overall, this study implies that the increasing frequency of NPF and fog-related particle processing can affect Arctic cloud properties in the summertime boundary layer.",

In response to vaccine shortages, several countries implemented dose-sparing vaccination strategies, stretching a full-dose vaccine vial into up to five fractional-dose vaccines. Recent studies have found mixed results regarding the effectiveness of the mpox vaccine, raising the question of the utility of dose-sparing strategies. We used an age- and risk-stratified mathematical model of an urban MSM population in the United States with \u223c12% high-risk MSM to evaluate potential benefits from implementing dose-sparing vaccination strategies in which a full dose is divided into 3.5 fractional doses. We found that results strongly depend on the fractional-dose vaccine effectiveness (VE) and vaccine supply. With very limited vaccines available, enough to protect with a full dose approximately one-third of the high-risk population, dose-sparing strategies are more beneficial provided that fractional doses preserved at least 40% of full-dose effectiveness (34% absolute VE), projecting 13% (34% VE) to 70% (68% absolute VE) fewer infections than full-dose strategies. In contrast, if vaccine supply is enough to cover the majority of the high-risk population, dose-sparing strategies can be outperformed by full-dose strategies. Scenarios in which fractional dosing was 34% efficacious resulted in almost three times more infections than full dosing. Our analysis suggests that when mpox vaccine supply is limited and fractional-dose vaccination retains moderate effectiveness, there are meaningful health benefits from providing a smaller dose to a larger number of people in the high-risk population. These findings should inform the public-health response to future mpox outbreaks.",

We leverage recursive partitioning techniques and identify that the overall positive treatment effect masks subpopulations where the treatment is even more effective and other groups where the treatment has a significant negative effect, decreasing contribution rates. Accounting for this variation is significant for theoretical and policy development as well as firm profitability. Our work also provides a methodological framework for how to better design, scale, and deploy behavioral interventions to maximize their effectiveness.",

Nonetheless, only a small fraction of patients respond to immunotherapy, and the costs and side effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors cannot be ignored. With the advent of machine and deep learning, clinical and genetic data have been used to stratify patient responses to immunotherapy. Unfortunately, these approaches have typically been \"black-box\" methods that are unable to explain their predictions, thereby hindering their responsible clinical application. Herein, we developed a \"white-box\" Bayesian network model that achieves accurate and interpretable predictions of immunotherapy responses against nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This tree-augmented na\u00efve Bayes (TAN) model accurately predicted durable clinical benefits and distinguished two clinically significant subgroups with distinct prognoses. Furthermore, our state-of-the-art white-box TAN approach achieved greater accuracy than previous methods. We hope that our model will guide clinicians in selecting NSCLC patients who truly require immunotherapy and expect our approach to be easily applied to other types of cancer.",

A canonical self-avoidance model seems to provide a central mechanistic basis for Dscam1 functions in neuronal wiring. Here, we reveal extensive noncanonical functions of Dscam1 isoforms in neuronal wiring. We generated a series of allelic <i>cis</i> mutations in <i>Dscam1</i>, encoding a normal number of isoforms, but with an altered isoform composition. Despite normal dendritic self-avoidance and self-/nonself-discrimination in dendritic arborization (da) neurons, which is consistent with the canonical self-avoidance model, these mutants exhibited strikingly distinct spectra of phenotypic defects in the three types of neurons: up to &#8764;60% defects in mushroom bodies, a significant increase in branching and growth in da neurons, and mild axonal branching defects in mechanosensory neurons. Remarkably, the altered isoform composition resulted in increased dendrite growth yet inhibited axon growth. Moreover, reducing Dscam1 dosage exacerbated axonal defects in mushroom bodies and mechanosensory neurons but reverted dendritic branching and growth defects in da neurons. This splicing-tuned regulation strategy suggests that axon and dendrite growth in diverse neurons cell-autonomously require Dscam1 isoform composition. These findings provide important insights into the functions of Dscam1 isoforms in neuronal wiring.",

The need for improving the filtering efficiency performance to prevent penetration of fine particulate matter (PM), which can be potential bacteria or virus carriers, has led the research into developing new methods and techniques for face mask fabrication. In this perspective, Electrospinning has shown to be the most efficient technique to get either synthetic or natural polymers-based fibers with size down to the nanoscale providing remarkable performance in terms of both particle filtration and breathability. The aim of this Review is to give further insight into the implementation of electrospun nanofibers for the realization of the next generation of face masks, with functionalized membranes via addiction of active material to the polymer solutions that can give optimal features about antibacterial, antiviral, self-sterilization, and electrical energy storage capabilities. Furthermore, the recent advances regarding the use of renewable materials and green solvent strategies to improve the sustainability of electrospun membranes and to fabricate eco-friendly filters are here discussed, especially in view of the large-scale nanofiber production where traditional membrane manufacturing may result in a high environmental and health risk.",

The structures were determined by ultraviolet spectroscopy (UV), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>1</sup>H NMR), <sup>13</sup>C NMR, and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation. Molinspiration and Osiris property explorer applications were used to predict bioactivity and drug score. Drug scores of 0.08 and 0.05 were predicted for compounds 1 and 2, respectively. Predicted bioactivity scores were high. Due to their molecular weight, chemical structure, and conformation, the newly discovered proanthocyanidins possess an inclination to interact with proteins. Based on this premise, both compounds were subjected to <i>in vitro</i> testing against ruminal enzymes. They exhibited significant inhibition activities (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) with a range of half maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) of 14.80-17.88 mg/mL of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase in both protozoa and bacteria fractions. The ruminal glutamic pyruvic transaminase activity was significantly inhibited (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) from EC<sub>50</sub> 12.59-16.29 mg/mL, and R-cellulase inhibition was recorded with EC<sub>50</sub> 18.20-21.98 mg/mL by compounds 1 and 2, respectively.

However, equine metabolic syndrome has only been recognized in recent decades. Functioning energy metabolism is pivotal to normal body homeostasis and affects essentially all organ systems, including reproduction. Previous literature suggests that obesity has an effect not only on the reproductive processes in mares but also on offspring health, predisposing the offspring to later-onset orthopedic and metabolic problems. This review focuses on the effects of obesity, insulin dysregulation and hyperinsulinemia on the reproductive functions of mares and the implications on foal health before and after birth. The points of interest are the cyclicity and ovarian function, uterine environment, gestation, the postpartum period, and the newborn foal. The aim is to review the current state of knowledge, and identify outstanding questions that could stimulate future research. This topic is important not only from the equine industry and production perspective but is also relevant for the welfare of future populations and individuals.",

Reaching a diagnosis may also be limited by a lack of available clinical profile parameter reference ranges to discriminate healthy fish from those affected by specific disease conditions. Here, we describe our experience investigating poorly performing rainbow trout (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) in an intensive recirculation aquaculture, where reaching a final diagnosis of nephrocalcinosis was not as straightforward as one would wish. To list the issues making the diagnosis difficult, it was necessary to consider the creeping onset of the problem. Further diagnostic steps needed to ensure success included obtaining comparative data for fish blood profiles and water quality from both test and control aquacultural systems, excluding infections with salmonid pathogenic agents and evaluating necropsy findings. Major events in the pathophysiology of nephrocalcinosis could be reconstructed as follows: aquatic environment hyperoxia and hypercapnia &#8594; blood hypercapnia &#8594; blood acid-base perturbation (respiratory acidosis) &#8594; metabolic compensation (blood bicarbonate elevation and kidney phosphate excretion) &#8594; a rise in blood pH &#8594; calcium phosphate precipitation and deposition in tissues. This case highlights the need to consider the interplay between water quality and fish health when diagnosing fish diseases and reaching causal diagnoses.",

However, the precise mechanism of action is not fully understood. Among the proposed hypotheses are the reduction of ruminal digestibility, direct control action on protozoa, reduction of archaea, and a hydrogen sink mechanism. In this <i>in vitro</i> study, which simulated rumen fermentation, two additives, one containing CTs (70% based on DM) from quebracho and one with HTs (75% based on DM) from chestnut, at four levels of inclusion (2, 4, 6, 8% on an as-fed basis) were added to the fermentation substrate and tested against a negative control. Both types of tannins significantly reduced total gas (GP) and CH<sub>4</sub> (ml/g DM) production during the 48&#8201;h of incubation. The lower GP and CH<sub>4</sub> production levels were linked to the reduction in dry matter digestibility caused by CTs and HTs. Conversely, no significant differences were observed for the protozoan and archaeal populations, suggesting a low direct effect of tannins on these rumen microorganisms <i>in vitro</i>. However, both types of tannins had negative correlations for the families Bacteroidales_BS11 and F082 and positive correlations for the genera <i>Prevotella</i> and <i>Succinivibrio</i>. Regarding the fermentation parameters, no differences were observed for pH and total volatile fatty acid production, while both CTs and HTs linearly reduced the NH<sub>3</sub> content. CTs from quebracho were more effective in reducing CH<sub>4</sub> production than HTs from chestnut. However, for both types of tannins, the reduction in CH<sub>4</sub> production was always associated with a lower digestibility without any changes in archaea or protozoa. Due to the high variability of tannins, further studies investigating the chemical structure of the compounds and their mechanisms of action are needed to understand the different results reported in the literature.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the importance of differentiating between low viable (secondary crushing losses) and viable crushed (primary crushing losses) piglets for the evaluation of risk factors for crushing related to characteristics of the sow, the litter, and the environment. Eleven Swiss farmers recorded sows' production data (parity class, gestation length, numbers of live-born and stillborn piglets), data (age, sex, weight, cause of death, and signs of weakness) for every live-born piglet that died in the first week after birth (piglet loss), and ambient temperature. Piglet losses were assigned to five categorical events: <i>piglet loss</i>, subdivided into <i>not crushed</i> and <i>crushed</i>, the latter being further subdivided into <i>low viable crushed</i> and <i>viable crushed</i>. Piglets recorded by the farmer as <i>crushed</i> were assigned to the events <i>low viable crushed</i> and <i>viable crushed</i> based on the piglet's body weight and signs of weakness (diseases, malformations). Data of 9,543 live-born piglets from 740 litters were eventually used to statistically model the hazard of dying at any given time in the first week after birth due to one of these events (mixed-effects Cox model). Five potential risk factors were analyzed as co-variates: parity class, gestation length, number of live-born piglets, number of stillborn piglets, and daily number of hours with ambient temperature &gt;30&#176;C. We identified two risk factors for dying from the event <i>viable crushed</i> that were not identified as risk factors for <i>low viable crushed</i>, namely shorter gestation length and higher daily number of hours with ambient temperature&#8201; &gt;&#8201;30&#176;C. <i>Vice-versa</i>, we identified additional live-born piglets in the litter as risk factor for <i>low viable crushed</i>, but not for <i>viable crushed</i>. Our results show the importance of differentiating between low viable and viable crushed piglets for the interpretation of risk factors for crushing losses. Therefore, we suggest that for breeding purposes and in research, this differentiation should be made.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "Hip dysplasia (HD) is a common orthopedic problem in young dogs. To decrease the laxity of the hip joint related to HD, the surgical treatments are recommended to increase femoral head coverage. ACEtabular rim eXtension (ACE-X) using a personalized 3-dimensional printed titanium shelf implant is a new surgical treatment to increase femoral head coverage and decrease laxity of the dysplastic hip joint, however, the efficacy is less know. Client-owned dogs older than 6 months with clinical signs of coxofemoral joint subluxation and radiographic evidence of HD with no or mild osteoarthritis (OA) were included. The Norberg angle (NA), linear percentage of femoral head overlap (LFO), and percentage of femoral head coverage (PC) were investigated radiographically and with computed tomography (CT) before and after surgery. OA was graded (scores 0-3) according to the maximum osteophyte size measured on CT. In addition, joint laxity (Ortolani) test results, gait analysis, and the Helsinki chronic pain index (HCPI) questionnaire were obtained at preoperative, immediately postoperative and at 1.5- and 3-month evaluations. Acetabular rim extension was performed in 61 hips of 34 dogs; NA, LFO, and PC were significantly higher immediately postoperatively and at the 1.5- and 3-month follow-up examinations compared with preoperative values (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Osteophyte size gradually increased over time (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The OA score significantly increased between preoperatively and directly postoperatively, and between preoperatively and at 3-month follow-up (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The laxity test normalized in 59 out of 61 hips after surgery, and the HCPI questionnaire showed that the pain score decreased significantly at 1.5 and 3 months, postoperatively. The force plate showed no significant improvement during the 3 months follow-up. Although pain reduction by the implant was unclear in short-term results, a personalized shelf implant significantly increased femoral head coverage and eliminated subluxation of the dysplastic hip joint. Further studies are required to study the long-term efficacy of gait, chronic pain, and progression of osteoarthritis.",

Additionally, with pituitary tumor invasion into the fixed space of the cavernous sinus, compression of multiple cranial nerves can result in cavernous sinus syndrome (CSS). We describe a case of an undiagnosed pituitary tumor manifesting as abrupt PA with CSS during hemodialysis (HD). <i>Clinical Case</i>. A 77-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) presented with acute onset of severe headache, decreased vision, ophthalmoplegia of the left eye, and hypotension during HD. MRI of the brain revealed a 2.5&#8201;cm pituitary adenoma with acute hemorrhage, compression of the left prechiasmatic optic nerve, and invasion into the left cavernous sinus (CS). The hormonal profile was consistent with multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies. The patient was treated with glucocorticoids and underwent transsphenoidal resection of the tumor.

Accurate seizure recording particularly at night can be challenging in PwID. Neuro Event Labs seizure monitoring (Nelli) uses high-quality video based artificial intelligence to detect and record possible nocturnal seizures. This study looks to evaluate the clinical utility and acceptability of Nelli in PwID and epilepsy. Family/carers of PwID and drug resistant epilepsy with suspicions of nocturnal seizures who had not tolerated routine or ambulatory EEGs were invited to evaluate Nelli. Relevant demographics and clinical characteristics were collected. Nelli's impact, it's facilitators, barriers and feedback quality was captured from patient and professional stakeholders. Quantitative and thematic analysis was undertaken. Fifteen PwID and epilepsy and four health professionals were involved. Nelli recorded 707 possible seizure events across the study cohort of which 247 were not heard or recognised by carers. Carers recorded 165 episodes of 'restless' or \"seizure behaviour\" which the Nelli did not deem to be seizures. There was 93% acceptability. Thematic analysis revealed three broad themes of device acceptability, result implementation and possible seizure recognition ability. Nelli allowed for improved communication and care planning in a hitherto difficult to investigate population.",

Such divergence can also be seen in genetic ALS cases with varying phenotypes bearing specific mutations, suggesting epigenetic mechanisms like DNA methylation act as disease modifiers. However, the epigenotype dictated by, in addition to other mechanisms, DNA methylation is also strongly influenced by the individual's genotype. Hence, we performed a DNA methylation study using EPIC arrays on 7 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant for ALS in whole blood, which serves as an ideal model for eliminating the effects of the genetic-epigenetic interplay to a large extent. We found one CpG site showing intra-pair hypermethylation in the affected co-twins, which maps to the Glutamate Ionotropic Receptor Kainate Type Subunit 1 gene (<i>GRIK1)</i>. Additionally, we found 4 DMPs which were subsequently confirmed using 2 different statistical approaches. Differentially methylated regions or blocks could not be detected within the scope of this work. In conclusion, we revealed that despite a low sample size, monozygotic twin studies discordant for the disease can bring new insights into epigenetic processes in ALS, pointing to new target loci for further investigations.",

Thus, designing materials that can serve as both SFC materials and wound care is highly desired, and remains a challenge.

    "original_csv_abstract": "Delayed bone defect repairs lead to severe health and socioeconomic impacts on patients. Hence, there are increasing demands for medical interventions to promote bone defect healing. Recombinant proteins such as BMP-2 have been recognized as one of the powerful osteogenic substances that promote mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to osteoblast differentiation and are widely applied clinically for bone defect repairs. However, recent reports show that BMP-2 treatment has been associated with clinical adverse side effects such as ectopic bone formation, osteolysis and stimulation of inflammation. Here, we have identified one new osteogenic protein, named 'HKUOT-S2' protein, from <i>Dioscorea opposita</i> Thunb<i>.</i> Using the bone defect model, we have shown that the HKUOT-S2 protein can accelerate bone defect repair by activating the mTOR signaling axis of MSCs-derived osteoblasts and increasing osteoblastic biomineralization. The HKUOT-S2 protein can also modulate the transcriptomic changes of macrophages, stem cells, and osteoblasts, thereby enhancing the crosstalk between the polarized macrophages and MSCs-osteoblast differentiation to facilitate osteogenesis. Furthermore, this protein had no toxic effects <i>in vivo</i>. We have also identified HKUOT-S2 peptide sequence TKSSLPGQTK as a functional osteogenic unit that can promote osteoblast differentiation <i>in vitro</i>. The HKUOT-S2 protein with robust osteogenic activity could be a potential alternative osteoanabolic agent for promoting osteogenesis and bone defect repairs. We believe that the HKUOT-S2 protein may potentially be applied clinically as a new class of osteogenic agent for bone defect healing.",

The high-glucose environment leads to persistent bacterial infection and mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in chronic inflammation, abnormal vascular function, and tissue necrosis. To solve these issues, we developed a double-network hydrogel, constructed with pluronic F127 diacrylate (F127DA) and hyaluronic acid methacrylate (HAMA), and enhanced by SS31-loaded mesoporous polydopamine nanoparticles (MPDA NPs). As components, SS31, a mitochondria-targeted peptide, maintains mitochondrial function, reduces mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thus regulates macrophage polarization, as well as promoting cell proliferation and migration, while MPDA NPs not only scavenge ROS and exert an anti-bacterial effect by photothermal treatment under near-infrared light irradiation, but also control release of SS31 in response to ROS. This F127DA/HAMA-MPDA@SS31 (FH-M@S) hydrogel has characteristics of adhesion, superior biocompatibility and mechanical properties which can adapt to irregular wounds at different body sites and provide sustained release of MPDA@SS31 (M@S) NPs. In addition, in a diabetic rat full thickness skin defect model, the FH-M@S hydrogel promoted macrophage M2 polarization, collagen deposition, neovascularization and wound healing. Therefore, the FH-M@S hydrogel exhibits promising therapeutic potential for skin regeneration.",

Currently, several imaging procedures, including diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), intensified computed tomography and positron emission tomography are routinely used for targeted tumor delineation. However, the performance of these imaging procedures has not yet been comprehensively evaluated. In order to address this matter, the present study was conducted in an aim to assess the use of DW-MRI in guiding radiotherapy treatments, by comparing its performance to that of other imaging procedures. Specifically, the exposure dosages to organs at risk, including the lungs, heart and spinal mencord, were evaluated using various radiotherapy regimes. The findings of the present study demonstrated that DW-MRI is a non-invasive and cost-effective imaging procedure that can be used to reduce lung exposure doses, minimizing the risk of radiation pneumonitis. The data further demonstrate the immense potential of the DW-MRI procedure in the precision radiotherapy of lung cancers.",

Exaggerated structures are often costly and, therefore, thought to be expressed in a condition-dependent manner. Sexual selection theory thus predicts a direct link between directional sexual selection, sexual dimorphism, and sex-specific condition dependence. However, only a handful of studies investigate the relationship between sexual dimorphism and condition dependence. Using 21 genetic lines of <i>Drosophila prolongata</i>, we here compared the degree of sexual dimorphism and sex-specific condition dependence, measured as allometric slopes, in sexually selected and non-sexual traits. Our data revealed male-biased sexual dimorphism in all traits examined, most prominently in the sexually selected forelegs. However, there was no relationship between the degree of sex-specific condition dependence and sexual dimorphism across traits and genetic lines. Our results contradict theoretical predictions and highlight the importance of understanding the role of exaggerated traits in the context of both sexual and natural selection.",

The thin gold film improved the laser absorptivity, decreasing the ripple generation threshold in liquids. High spatial frequency ripples exhibited lower angular deviation than low spatial frequency ones, but in water the deviation was comparable for both types of ripples. The initiation of nanoripples may precede nanoparticle generation, which is why in hexane several cuboid Au particles were trapped between the ripples. Fast cooling processes freeze ejected molten droplets during the phase explosion and surface reorganization. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction of samples processed in butanol showed a small shift toward smaller angles for the Ni phase, indicating a lattice expansion due to higher tensile stress. Confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy detected surface graphitization and amorphization in areas laser-treated in ethanol, butanol, and hexane, with the highest carbonization observed in butanol. Presumably, femtosecond laser-induced photolysis triggers the formation of graphite nanocrystallites, and consecutive pulses cause amorphization. Static contact angle measurements showed a general tendency toward hydrophobicity with highest contact angles for rippled areas created in butanol.",

Parents facilitated their children's involvement by sharing information and seeking their opinions. Whereas some participants described youth as having a substantial decision-making role, not all youth felt they were involved, and some youth could not recall conversations about rhGH.

GIP is important in a multitude of contexts from cancer, to microbial infections, to biofouling, yet our understanding of its origin and molecular consequences remains limited. Here, we combine microfluidic confinement of the yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, with rheological measurements using genetically encoded multimeric nanoparticles (GEMs) to reveal that growth-induced pressure is accompanied with an increase in a key cellular physical property: macromolecular crowding. We develop a fully calibrated model that predicts how increased macromolecular crowding hinders protein expression and thus diminishes cell growth. This model is sufficient to explain the coupling of growth rate to pressure without the need for specific molecular sensors or signaling cascades. As molecular crowding is similar across all domains of life, this could be a deeply conserved mechanism of biomechanical feedback that allows environmental sensing originating from the fundamental physical properties of cells.",

The succession of these fungi could benefit beetle hosts by optimal consumption of the substrate and extended longevity of the nest. However, abundances of fungal cultivars and other symbionts are poorly known and their culture-independent quantification over development has been studied in only a single species. Here, for the first time, we compared the diversity and succession of both fungal and bacterial communities of fungus gardens in the fruit-tree pinhole borer, <i>Xyleborinus saxesenii</i>, from field and laboratory nests over time. By amplicon sequencing of probed fungus gardens of both nest types at three development phases we showed an extreme reduction of diversity in both bacterial and fungal symbionts in laboratory nests. Furthermore, we observed a general transition from nutritional to non-beneficial fungal symbionts during beetle development. While one known nutritional mutualist, <i>Raffaelea canadensis</i>, was occurring more or less stable over time, the second mutualist <i>R. sulphurea</i> was dominating young nests and decreased in abundance at the expense of other secondary fungi. The quicker the succession proceeded, the slower offspring beetles developed, suggesting a negative role of these secondary symbionts. Finally, we found signs of transgenerational costs of late dispersal for daughters, possibly as early dispersers transmitted and started their own nests with less of the non-beneficial taxa. Future studies should focus on the functional roles of the few bacterial taxa that were present in both field and laboratory nests.",

Non-aureus staphylococci (NAS) are currently one of the main pathogens associated with difficult-to-treat intramammary infections. Biofilm is an important virulence factor that can protect bacteria against antimicrobial treatment and prevent their recognition by the host's immune system. Previously, we found that chronic mastitis isolates which were refractory to antibiotic therapy developed strong biofilm biomass. Now, we evaluated the influence of biofilm biomass intensity on the antibiotic resistance pattern in strong and weak biofilm-forming NAS isolates from clinical mastitis. We also assessed the effect of cloxacillin (Clx) and chitosan (Ch), either alone or in combination, on NAS isolates with different lifestyles and abilities to form biofilm. The antibiotic resistance pattern was not the same in strong and weak biofilm producers, and there was a significant association (<i>p</i>&#8201;&#8804;&#8201;0.01) between biofilm biomass intensity and antibiotic resistance. Bacterial viability assays showed that a similar antibiotic concentration was effective at killing both groups when they grew planktonically. In contrast, within biofilm the concentrations needed to eliminate strong producers were 16 to 128 times those needed for weak producers, and more than 1,000 times those required for planktonic cultures. Moreover, Ch alone or combined with Clx had significant antimicrobial activity, and represented an improvement over the activity of the antibiotic on its own, independently of the bacterial lifestyle, the biofilm biomass intensity or the antibiotic resistance pattern. In conclusion, the degree of protection conferred by biofilm against antibiotics appears to be associated with the intensity of its biomass, but treatment with Ch might be able to help counteract it. These findings suggest that bacterial biomass should be considered when designing new antimicrobial therapies aimed at reducing antibiotic concentrations while improving cure rates.",

A total of 4,278 open reading frames (ORFs) were identified in the genome and the coding density was found to be 87.8%. A comparative genomic analysis was conducted using two other <i>L. plantarum</i> strains, <i>L. plantarum</i> C11 and <i>L. plantarum</i> LMG21703. Genomic comparison revealed that <i>L. plantarum</i> YW11 shared 72.7 and 75.2% of gene content with <i>L. plantarum</i> C11 and <i>L. plantarum</i> LMG21703, respectively. Most of the genes shared between the three <i>L. plantarum</i> strains were involved in carbohydrate metabolism, energy production and conversion, amino acid metabolism, and transcription. In this analysis, 10 previously sequenced entire genomes of the species were compared using an <i>in-silico</i> technique to discover genomic divergence in genes linked with carbohydrate intake and their potential adaptations to distinct human intestinal environments. The subspecies pan-genome was open, which correlated with its extraordinary capacity to colonize several environments. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the novel genomes were homogenously grouped among subspecies of l <i>Lactiplantibacillus. L. plantarum</i> was resistant to cefoxitin, erythromycin, and metronidazole, inhibited pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium difficile, Vibrio cholera, and others, and had excellent aerotolerance, which is useful for industrial operations. The comparative genomic analysis of <i>L. plantarum</i> YW11 isolated from Tibetan kefir can provide insights into the genetic characteristics of the strain, which can be used to further understand its role in the production of kefir.",

In this study, EV and functional proteins were found in five different commercial dairy-fermented products carrying <i>L. paracasei</i>. Strains present in those products were isolated, and with one exception, all produced small EVs (24-47 d.nm) carrying P40 and P75. In order to winnow bacterial EV from milk EV, products were subjected to centrifugal fractionation at 15,000 &#215; <i>g</i> (15 K), 33,000 &#215; <i>g</i> (33 K), and 100,000 &#215; <i>g</i> (100 K). P75 was present in all supernatants and pellets, but P40 was only found in two products bound to the 15 and 33 K pellets, and 16S rDNA of <i>L. paracasei</i> could be amplified from all 100 K EVs, indicating the presence of <i>L. paracasei</i> EV. To investigate the interactions of bacterial EV and proteins with milk EV, <i>L. paracasei</i> BL23 EV was added to three commercial UHT milk products. Small-size vesicles (50-60 d.nm) similar to <i>L. paracasei</i> BL23 EV were found in samples from 100 K centrifugations, but intriguingly, P40 and P75 were bound to EV in 15 and 33 K pellets, containing bovine milk EV of larger size (200-300 d.nm). Sequencing 16S rDNA bands amplified from EV evidenced the presence of bacterial EVs of diverse origins in milk and fermented products. Furthermore, <i>L. paracasei</i> 16S rDNA could be amplified with species-specific primers from all samples, showing the presence of <i>L. paracasei</i> EV in all EV fractions (15, 33, and 100 K), suggesting that these bacterial EVs possibly aggregate and are co-isolated with EV from milk. P40 and P75 proteins would be interacting with specific populations of milk EV (15 and 33 K) because they were detected bound to them in fermented products and milk, and this possibly forced the sedimentation of part of <i>L. paracasei</i> EV at lower centrifugal forces. This study has solved technically complex problems and essential questions which will facilitate new research focusing on the molecular behavior of probiotics during fermentation and the mechanisms of action mediating the health benefits of fermented products.",

To better understand this detrimental potential, investigations on the reservoirs of bacterial pathogens and antimicrobial resistance on the surfaces of gymnastic equipment were performed by analyzing the bacterial community structures, prevalence of viable bacteria, and presence of antimicrobial resistance on both indoor and outdoor gymnastic facilities. The results of high-throughput 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing showed that Gram-positive bacteria on the surfaces of indoor gymnastic equipment significantly enriched, including the opportunistic pathogen <i>Staphylococcus</i> strains, while Enterobacteriaceae significantly enriched on surfaces of outdoor gymnastic equipment. The analysis of &#945;-diversities showed a higher richness and diversity for bacterial communities on the surfaces of gymnastic equipment than the environment. Analysis of &#946;-diversities showed that the bacterial communities on the surfaces of gymnastic equipment differ significantly from environmental bacterial communities, while the bacterial communities on indoor and outdoor equipment are also significantly different. Thirty-four bacterial isolates were obtained from the surfaces of gymnastic equipment, including three multidrug <i>Staphylococcus</i> and one multidrug resistant <i>Pantoea</i>. In particular, <i>Staphylococcus hemolyticus</i> 5-6, isolated from the dumbbell surface, is a multidrug resistant, hemolytic, high- risk pathogen. The results of quantitative PCR targeting antibiotic resistance related genes (<i>intI1</i>, <i>sul1</i> and <i>bla</i> <sub>TEM</sub>) showed that the abundances of <i>sul1</i> and <i>bla</i> <sub>TEM</sub> genes on the surfaces of gymnastic equipment are higher than the environment, while the abundances of <i>sul1</i> gene on indoor equipment are higher than outdoor equipment. These results lead to the conclusion that the surfaces of gymnastic equipment are potential dissemination pathways for highly dangerous pathogens as well as antimicrobial resistance, and the risks of indoor equipment are higher than outdoor equipment.",

They contain neutral lipids, tocopherols, quinones, chlorophyll metabolites, carotenoids and their derivatives. Proteomic studies indicated that plastoglobules are involved in carotenoid metabolism and storage. In this study, one of the plastid lipid-associated proteins (PAP), the major protein in plastoglobules, was selected and overexpressed in <i>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</i>. The diameter of the plastoglobules in mutants was decreased by a mean of 19.2% versus the wild-type, while the fucoxanthin level was increased by a mean of 51.2%. All mutants exhibited morphological differences from the wild-type, including a prominent increase in the transverse diameter. Moreover, the unsaturated fatty acid levels were increased in different mutants, including an 18.9-59.3% increase in eicosapentaenoic acid content. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that PAP expression and the morphological changes altered xanthophyll synthesis and storage, which affected the assembly of the fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c-binding protein and expression of antenna proteins as well as reduced the non-photochemical quenching activity of diatom cells. Therefore, metabolic regulation at the suborganelle level can be achieved by modulating PAP expression. These findings provide a subcellular structural site and target for synthetic biology to modify pigment and lipid metabolism in microalgae chassis cells.",

Current anti-viral strategies focus on vaccination or targeting key viral proteins with antibodies and drugs. However, the ongoing evolution of new variants that evade vaccination or may become drug-resistant is a major challenge. Thus, antiviral compounds that circumvent these obstacles are needed. Here we describe an innovative antiviral modality based on <i>in silico</i> designed fully synthetic mRNA that is replication incompetent in uninfected cells (termed herein PSCT: parasitic anti-SARS-CoV-2 transcript). The PSCT sequence was engineered to include key untranslated cis-acting regulatory RNA elements of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, so as to effectively compete for replication and packaging with the standard viral genome. Using the Vero E6 cell-culture based SARS-CoV-2 infection model, we determined that the intracellular delivery of liposome-encapsulated PSCT at 1 hour post infection significantly reduced intercellular SARS-CoV-2 replication and release into the extracellular milieu as compared to mock treatment. In summary, our findings are a proof-of-concept for the therapeutic feasibility of <i>in silico</i> designed mRNA compounds formulated to hinder the replication and packaging of ssRNA viruses sharing a comparable genomic-structure with beta-CoVs.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 sparked intensive research into the development of effective vaccines, 50 of which have been approved thus far, including the novel mRNA-based vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna. Although limiting the severity of the disease, the mRNA-based vaccines presented drawbacks, such as the cold chain requirement. Moreover, antibody levels generated by these vaccines decline significantly after 6\u2009months. These vaccines deliver mRNA encoding the full-length spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, but must be updated as new strains and variants of concern emerge, creating a demand for adjusted formulations and booster campaigns. To overcome these challenges, we have developed COVID-19 vaccine candidates based on the highly conserved SARS CoV-2, 809-826 B-cell peptide epitope (denoted 826) conjugated to cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) nanoparticles and bacteriophage Q\u03b2 virus-like particles, both platforms have exceptional thermal stability and facilitate epitope delivery with inbuilt adjuvant activity. We evaluated two administration methods: subcutaneous injection and an implantable polymeric scaffold. Mice received a prime-boost regimen of 100\u2009\u03bcg per dose (2\u2009weeks apart) or a single dose of 200\u2009\u03bcg administered as a liquid formulation, or a polymer implant. Antibody titers were evaluated longitudinally over 50\u2009weeks. The vaccine candidates generally elicited an early Th2-biased immune response, which stimulates the production of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, followed by a switch to a Th1-biased response for most formulations. Exceptionally, vaccine candidate 826-CPMV (administered as prime-boost, soluble injection) elicited a balanced Th1/Th2 immune response, which is necessary to prevent pulmonary immunopathology associated with Th2 bias extremes. While the Q\u03b2-based vaccine elicited overall higher antibody titers, the CPMV-induced antibodies had higher avidity. Regardless of the administration route and formulation, our vaccine candidates maintained high antibody titers for more than 50\u2009weeks, confirming a potent and durable immune response against SARS-CoV-2 even after a single dose.",

So far, little attention has been paid to the characterization of the aerosolization process. In this study, fecal and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) samples were collected from 20 animal farms involving swine, cattle, layers, and broilers, and the ARGs, ARB, and human pathogenic bacteria (HPB) were loaded in these two media. The results showed that approximately 70% of ARGs, 60% of ARBs, and 43% of HPBs were found to be preferential aerosolization. The bioaerosolization index (BI) of target 30 ARGs varied from 0.04 to 460.07, and the highest value was detected from <i>tetW</i>. The highest BI values of erythromycin- and tetracycline-resistant bacteria were for <i>Kocuria</i> (13119) and <i>Staphylococcus</i> (24746), respectively, and the distribution of BI in the two types of dominant ARB was similar. Regarding the bioaerosolization behavior of HPB, <i>Clostridium saccharolyticum</i> WM1 was the most easily aerosolized pathogen in swine and broiler farms, and <i>Brucella abortus</i> strain CNM 20040339 had the highest value in cattle and layer farms. Notably, the highest BI values for ARGs, ARB, and HPB were universally detected on chicken farms. Most ARGs, ARB, and HPB positively correlated with animal age, stocking density, and breeding area. Temperature and relative humidity have significant effects on the aerosolization behavior of targets, and the effects of these two parameters on the same target are usually opposite. The results of this study provide a basis for a better understanding of the contribution of animal feces to airborne ARGs and HPBs in farms, as well as for controlling the transport of the fecal microbiome to the environment through the aerosolization pathway.",

This study analyzed the relationship between the diversity of rhizosphere microbiota and the yield and quality of flue-cured tobacco at different transplant times (D30 group, D60 group and D90 group) and in different regions [Linxiang Boshang (BS) and Linxiang ZhangDuo (ZD)] by high-throughput sequencing technology. The results showed that there were significant differences in the physicochemical properties and rhizosphere microbiota of flue-cured tobacco rhizosphere soil at different transplanting times, and that the relative abundance of Bacillus in the rhizosphere microbiota of the D60 group was significantly increased. RDA and Pearson correlation analysis showed that <i>Bacillus</i>, <i>Streptomyces</i> and <i>Sphingomonas</i> were significantly correlated with soil physical and chemical properties. PIGRUSt2 function prediction results showed that compared with the D30 group, the D60 group had significantly increased metabolic pathways such as the superpathway of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside salvage, allantoin degradation to glyoxylate III and pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis III metabolic pathways. The D90 group had significantly increased metabolic pathways such as ubiquitol-8 biosynthesis (prokaryotic), ubiquitol-7 biosynthesis (prokaryotic) and ubiquitol-10 biosynthesis (prokaryotic) compared with the D60 group. In addition, the yield and quality of flue-cured tobacco in the BS region were significantly higher than those in the ZD region, and the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Bacillus in the rhizosphere microbiota of flue-cured tobacco in the BS region at the D60 transplant stage was significantly higher than that in the ZD region. In addition, the results of the hierarchical sample metabolic pathway abundance map showed that the PWY-6572 metabolic pathway was mainly realized by <i>Paenibacillus</i>, and that the relative abundance of flue-cured tobacco rhizosphere microbiota (<i>Paenibacillus</i>) participating in PWY-6572 in the D60 transplant period in the BS region was significantly higher than that in the ZD region. In conclusion, different transplanting periods of flue-cured tobacco have important effects on soil physical and chemical properties and rhizosphere microbial communities. There were significant differences in the rhizosphere microbiota and function of flue-cured tobacco in different regions, which may affect the performance and quality of this type of tobacco.",

The isolation and relatively late arrival of humans into New Zealand has meant there is a recorded history of the introduction of domestic species. Honey bees (<i>Apis mellifera</i>) were introduced to New Zealand in 1839, and the disease American foulbrood was subsequently found in the 1870s. <i>Paenibacillus larvae</i>, the causative agent of American foulbrood, has been genome sequenced in other countries. We sequenced the genomes of <i>P. larvae</i> obtained from 164 New Zealand apiaries where American foulbrood was identified in symptomatic hives during visual inspection. Multi-locus sequencing typing (MLST) revealed the dominant sequence type to be ST18, with this clonal cluster accounting for 90.2% of isolates. Only two other sequence types (with variants) were identified, ST5 and ST23. ST23 was only observed in the Otago area, whereas ST5 was limited to two geographically non-contiguous areas. The sequence types are all from the enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus I (ERIC I) genogroup. The ST18 and ST5 from New Zealand and international <i>P. larvae</i> all clustered by sequence type. Based on core genome MLST and SNP analysis, localized regional clusters were observed within New Zealand, but some closely related genomes were also geographically dispersed, presumably due to hive movements by beekeepers.",

Magroviruses - the viruses of MGII archaea have been recently found to occur ubiquitously in surface ocean. However, their diversity, distribution, and potential ecological functions in coastal zones especially brackish waters are unknown. Here we obtained 234 non-redundant magroviral genomes from brackish surface waters by using homology searches for viral signature proteins highlighting the uncovered vast diversity of this novel viral group. Phylogenetic analysis based on these brackish magroviruses along with previously reported marine ones identified six taxonomic groups with close evolutionary connection to both haloviruses and the viruses of Marine Group I archaea. Magroviruses were present abundantly both in brackish and open ocean samples with some showing habitat specification and others having broad spectrums of distribution between different habitats. Genome annotation suggests they may be involved in regulating multiple metabolic pathways of MGII archaea. Our results uncover the previously overlooked diversity and ecological potentials of a major archaeal virial group in global ocean and brackish waters and shed light on the cryptic evolutionary history of archaeal viruses.",

In the treatment of T2DM, synbiotics often regulate the composition of intestinal flora, which autoinducer-2 (AI-2) may play an important role. Whether the changes of intestinal flora are related to AI-2 during synbiotics treatment of T2DM is a topic worth studying. We elucidated the effects of synbiotic composed of mangiferin and <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i> 1-12 (SML) on T2DM rats. Male Spraque-Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with streptozotocin (STZ) and randomly grouped. After that, biochemical parameters, intestinal flora, fecal AI-2, and intestinal colonization of <i>L. reuteri</i> were detected. The results showed that SML had a hypoglycemic effect and mitigated the organ lesions of the liver and pancreas. Also, SML regulated biochemical parameters such as short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), lipopolysaccharides (LPS), intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;). On the other hand, the proportion of probiotics, such as <i>Lactobacillus acidophilus</i>, <i>L. reuteri</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium pseudolongum</i>, <i>Lactobacillus murinus</i>, and <i>Lactobacillus johnsonii</i>, were elevated by the treatment of SML. In addition, SML promoted the colonization and proliferation of <i>L. reuteri</i> in the gut. Another thing to consider was that AI-2 was positively correlated with the total number of OTUs sequences and SML boosted AI-2 in the gut. Taken together, these results supported that SML may modulate intestinal flora through AI-2 to treat T2DM. This study provided a novel alternative strategy for the treatment of T2DM in future.",

It derives from Biopiles, but phytoremediation is added to biostimulation with nitrogen fertilization and bioaugmentation with local bacteria. We have constructed seven Ecopiles with soil heavily polluted with hydrocarbons in Carlow (Ireland). The aim of the study was to analyze changes in the microbial community during ecopiling. In the course of 18\u2009months of remediation, total petroleum hydrocarbons values decreased in 99 and 88% on average for aliphatics and aromatics, respectively, indicating a successful biodegradation. Community analysis showed that bacterial alfa diversity (Shannon Index), increased with the degradation of hydrocarbons, starting at an average value of 7.59 and ending at an average value of 9.38. Beta-diversity analysis, was performed using Bray-Curtis distances and PCoA ordination, where the two first principal components (PCs) explain the 17 and 14% of the observed variance, respectively. The results show that samples tend to cluster by sampling time instead of by Ecopile. This pattern is supported by the hierarchical clustering analysis, where most samples from the same timepoint clustered together. We used DSeq2 to determine the differential abundance of bacterial populations in Ecopiles at the beginning and the end of the treatment. While TPHs degraders are more abundant at the start of the experiment, these populations are substituted by bacterial populations typical of clean soils by the end of the biodegradation process. Similar results are found for the fungal community, indicating that the microbial community follows a succession along the process. This succession starts with a TPH degraders or tolerant enriched community, and finish with a microbial community typical of clean soils.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "Under continuous human disturbance, regeneration is the basis for biodiversity persistence and ecosystem service provision. In tropical dry forests, edaphic ecosystem engineering by biological soil crusts (biocrusts) could impact regeneration by influencing erosion control and soil water and nutrient fluxes, which impact landscape hydrology, geomorphology, and ecosystem functioning. This study investigated the effect of cyanobacteria-dominated biocrusts on water infiltration and aggregate stability in a human-modified landscape of the Caatinga dry forest (NE Brazil), a system characterized by high levels of forest degradation and increasing aridity. By trapping dust and swelling of cyanobacterial filaments, biocrusts can seal soil surfaces and slow down infiltration, which potentially induces erosion. To quantify hydraulic properties and erosion control, we used minidisc-infiltrometry, raindrop-simulation, and wet sieving at two sites with contrasting disturbance levels: an active cashew plantation and an abandoned field experiencing forest regeneration, both characterized by sandy soils. Under disturbance, biocrusts had a stronger negative impact on infiltration (reduction by 42% vs. 37% during regeneration), although biocrusts under regenerating conditions had the lowest absolute sorptivity (0.042&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.02 cm&#8201;s<sup>-1/2</sup>) and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (0.0015&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.0008 cm&#8201;s<sup>-1</sup>), with a doubled water repellency. Biocrusts provided high soil aggregate stability although stability increased considerably with progression of biocrust succession (raindrop simulation disturbed: 0.19&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.22 J vs. regenerating: 0.54&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.22 J). The formation of stable aggregates by early successional biocrusts on sandy soils suggests protection of dry forest soils even on the worst land use/soil degradation scenario with a high soil erosion risk. Our results confirm that biocrusts covering bare interspaces between vascular plants in human-modified landscapes play an important role in surface water availability and erosion control. Biocrusts have the potential to reduce land degradation, but their associated ecosystem services like erosion protection, can be impaired by disturbance. Considering an average biocrust coverage of 8.1% of the Caatinga landscapes, further research should aim to quantify the contribution of biocrusts to forest recovery to fully understand the role they play in the functioning of this poorly explored ecosystem.",

However, the influences of dietary non-fibrous carbohydrate (NFC) to neutral detergent fiber (NDF) in different ratios on gut microbiota, metabolites, intestinal immunity, and growth performance have not been fully explored. A total of 135 healthy weaned rabbits (45.1 &#177; 0.7 d of age) with an average body weight of 1.08 &#177; 0.07 kg were randomly divided into five groups. Under the same other nutrient levels, rabbits were fed diets with NFC/NDF ratios of 0.7 (T1), 1.0 (T2), 1.3 (T3), 1.6 (T4), and 1.9 (T5). During the 28-day experiment, T3 rabbits showed the highest final body weight and the lowest feed-to-weight ratio than T5 rabbits (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) but no significant difference with T1 or T2 rabbits. The expression of cecal pro-inflammatory factors IL-1&#946; and TNF-&#945; was increased in the T4 and T5 than in those of other groups (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Conversely, the tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Claudin-1, and Occludin) were decreased to varying degrees in the T4 and T5 groups. The pH value in the cecal digesta of T5 rabbits was lower than that of T1, T2, and T3 (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), while the concentration of volatile fatty acids and propionate was higher than those of T1, T2, and T3 rabbits (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). In terms of gut microbiota, at the phylum level, the relative burden of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria in T2 rabbits was the highest (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05), and the relative burden of Proteobacteria in T5 rabbits was higher than that of other groups (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). At the genus level, the relative burden of <i>Ruminococcus</i> was higher in T2 and T3 rabbits than that of other groups, and T5 rabbits have the lowest relative burden of <i>Ruminococcus</i>. Combination analysis showed that cecal metabolites were positively associated with fermentation-related phenotypes and the burden of Firmicutes (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, different dietary NFC/NDF ratios can affect the intestinal immune response and growth performance of rabbits, and there was a positive effect when dietary NFC/NDF = 1.0-1.3.",

In this study, we investigate replication-induced gene copy numbers - a regulatory concept that is unlike the others not based on modulation of promoter activity but on replication dynamics. We show that a large fraction of genes are predominantly affected by transient copy numbers and identify cellular functions and central pathways governed by this mechanism in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Furthermore, we show quantitatively that the previously observed spatio-temporal expression pattern between different growth phases mainly emerges from transient chromosomal copy numbers. We extend the analysis to the plant pathogen <i>Dickeya dadantii</i> and the biotechnologically relevant organism <i>Vibrio natriegens</i>. The analysis reveals a connection between growth phase dependent gene expression and evolutionary gene migration in these species. A further extension to the bacterial kingdom indicates that chromosome evolution is governed by growth rate related transient copy numbers.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "The secretory proteome plays an important role in the pathogenesis of phytopathogenic fungi. However, the relationship between the large-scale secretome of phytopathogenic fungi and their lifestyle is not fully understood. In the present study, the secretomes of 150 plant pathogenic fungi were predicted and the characteristics associated with different lifestyles were investigated. In total, 94,974 secreted proteins (SPs) were predicted from these fungi. The number of the SPs ranged from 64 to 1,662. Among these fungi, hemibiotrophic fungi had the highest number (average of 970) and proportion (7.1%) of SPs. Functional annotation showed that hemibiotrophic and necrotroph fungi, differ from biotrophic and symbiotic fungi, contained much more carbohydrate enzymes, especially polysaccharide lyases and carbohydrate esterases. Furthermore, the core and lifestyle-specific SPs orthogroups were identified. Twenty-seven core orthogroups contained 16% of the total SPs and their motif function annotation was represented by serine carboxypeptidase, carboxylesterase and asparaginase. In contrast, 97 lifestyle-specific orthogroups contained only 1% of the total SPs, with diverse functions such as PAN_AP in hemibiotroph-specific and flavin monooxygenases in necrotroph-specific. Moreover, obligate biotrophic fungi had the largest number of effectors (average of 150), followed by hemibiotrophic fungi (average of 120). Among these effectors, 4,155 had known functional annotation and pectin lyase had the highest proportion in the functionally annotated effectors. In addition, 32 sets of RNA-Seq data on pathogen-host interactions were collected and the expression levels of SPs were higher than that of non-SPs, and the expression level of effector genes was higher in biotrophic and hemibiotrophic fungi than in necrotrophic fungi, while secretase genes were highly expressed in necrotrophic fungi. Finally, the secretory activity of five predicted SPs from <i>Setosphearia turcica</i> was experimentally verified. In conclusion, our results provide a foundation for the study of pathogen-host interaction and help us to understand the fungal lifestyle adaptation.",

The Cyanidiophyceae are a class of polyextremophilic red algae that natively inhabit acidic hot springs. <i>C. merolae</i> 10D has recently emerged as an interesting model organism capable of high-cell density cultivation on pure CO<sub>2</sub> with optimal growth at elevated temperatures and acidic pH. <i>C. merolae</i> biomass has an interesting macromolecular composition, is protein rich, and contains valuable bio-products like heat-stable phycocyanin, carotenoids, &#946;-glucan, and starch. Here, photobioreactors were used to model <i>C. merolae</i> 10D growth performance in simulated environmental conditions of the mid-Red Sea coast across four seasons, it was then grown at various scales outdoors in Thuwal, Saudi Arabia during the Summer of 2022. We show that <i>C. merolae</i> 10D is amenable to cultivation with industrial-grade nutrient and CO<sub>2</sub> inputs outdoors in this location and that its biomass is relatively constant in biochemical composition across culture conditions. We also show the adaptation of <i>C. merolae</i> 10D to high salinity levels of those found in Red Sea waters and conducted further modeled cultivations in nutrient enriched local sea water. It was determined that salt-water adapted <i>C. merolae</i> 10D could be cultivated with reduced nutrient inputs in local conditions. The results presented here indicate this may be a promising alternative species for algal bioprocesses in outdoor conditions in extreme coastal desert summer environments.",

The overall impact pertaining to significant membrane changes, through broad spectrum drugs have rendered the bacteria resistant over the years. The economic expenditure due to increasing drug resistance poses a global burden on healthcare community and must be dealt with immediate effect. Nanoparticles (NP) have demonstrated inherent therapeutic potential or can serve as nanocarriers of antibiotics against multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens. These carriers can mask the antibiotics and help evade the resistance mechanism of the bacteria. The targeted delivery can be fine-tuned through surface functionalization of Nanocarriers using aptamers, antibodies etc. This review covers various molecular mechanisms acquired by resistant bacteria towards membrane modification. Mechanistic insight on 'NP surface-bacterial membrane' interactions are crucial in deciding the role of NP as therapeutic. Finally, we highlight the potential accessible membrane targets for designing smart surface-functionalized nanocarriers which can act as bacteria-targeted robots over the existing clinically available antibiotics. As the bacterial strains around us continue to evolve into resistant versions, nanomedicine can offer promising and alternative tools in overcoming AMR.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "The increasing number of chronic and life-threatening infections caused by antimicrobial resistant fungal isolates is of critical concern. Low DNA sequencing cost may facilitate the identification of the genomic profile leading to resistance, the resistome, to rationally optimize the design of antifungal therapies. However, compared to bacteria, initiatives for resistome detection in eukaryotic pathogens are underdeveloped. Firstly, reported mutations in antifungal targets leading to reduced susceptibility must be extensively collected from the literature to generate comprehensive databases. This information should be complemented with specific laboratory screenings to detect the highest number possible of relevant genetic changes in primary targets and associations between resistance and other genomic markers. Strikingly, some drug resistant strains experience high-level genetic changes such as ploidy variation as much as duplications and reorganizations of specific chromosomes. Such variations involve allelic dominance, gene dosage increments and target expression regime effects that should be explicitly parameterized in antifungal resistome prediction algorithms. Clinical data indicate that predictors need to consider the precise pathogen species and drug levels of detail, instead of just genus and drug class. The concomitant needs for mutation accuracy and assembly quality assurance suggest hybrid sequencing approaches involving third-generation methods will be utilized. Moreover, fatal fast infections, like fungemia and meningitis, will further require both sequencing and analysis facilities are available in-house. Altogether, the complex nature of antifungal resistance demands extensive sequencing, data acquisition and processing, bioinformatic analysis pipelines, and standard protocols to be accomplished prior to genome-based protocols are applied in the clinical setting.",

To our knowledge, there is a paucity of information on antifungal potential of liquid smoke against toxigenic fungi like <i>Aspergillus flavus</i> that produce mycotoxins in human and pet foods. Semi-moist pet food with high moisture content (20-30%) is susceptible to mold contamination and requires intervention. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of liquid smoke preparations on the growth of wild-type mold and <i>A. flavus</i> in semi-moist pet food. Semi-moist pet food was formulated with eight different liquid smoke preparations (S1-S8) containing varying amounts of organic acids, phenol and carbonyl compounds (ranging from low to high) at 0% (untreated), 0.5, 1, 2, and 4% (w/w). A positive control consisted of 0.2% potassium sorbate known to inhibit mold growth. Shelf life was estimated by storing the samples at 28&#176;C and 65-70% RH over 30 days and recording the number of days until the appearance of visible wild-type mold. In another experiment, samples were spot inoculated with <i>A. flavus</i> (&#8764;10,000 CFU/mL), incubated at 25&#176;C, and analyzed for fungal growth at sampling intervals of 2 days over a 35-day period. Liquid smoke at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4% extended the shelf life of samples on an average by a total of 11.6, 12.5, 17.2, and 24.1 days when compared to the untreated samples (7.7 days). The smoke preparations Cloud S-C100 (S3) and Code-10 (S6) (high carbonyl, medium/low phenol) were the most effective (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) in prolonging the number of days to visible mold growth (26-28 days). In the challenge study with <i>A. flavus</i>, Cloud S-C100 (S3), Cloud S-AC15 (S8) (high to medium carbonyl, low phenol), and Code 10 (S6) (base smoke) reduced (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05) mold counts by 1.0, 1.7, and 2.5 logs when compared to the untreated samples at 1, 2, and 4%, respectively. Addition of smoke at 0.5% did not reduce mold counts.

    "original_csv_abstract": "Green sulfur bacteria (GSB) are a distinct group of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria that are found in many ecological niches. <i>Prosthecochloris</i>, a marine representative genus of GSB, was found to be dominant in some coral skeletons. However, how coral-associated <i>Prosthecochloris</i> (CAP) adapts to diurnal changing microenvironments in coral skeletons is still poorly understood. In this study, three <i>Prosthecochloris</i> genomes were obtained through enrichment culture from the skeleton of the stony coral <i>Galaxea fascicularis</i>. These divergent three genomes belonged to <i>Prosthecochloris marina</i> and two genomes were circular. Comparative genomic analysis showed that between the CAP and non-CAP clades, CAP genomes possess specialized metabolic capacities (CO oxidation, CO<sub>2</sub> hydration and sulfur oxidation), gas vesicles (vertical migration in coral skeletons), and <i>cbb</i> <sub>3</sub>-type cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidases (oxygen tolerance and gene regulation) to adapt to the microenvironments of coral skeletons. Within the CAP clade, variable polysaccharide synthesis gene clusters and phage defense systems may endow bacteria with differential cell surface structures and phage susceptibility, driving strain-level evolution. Furthermore, mobile genetic elements (MGEs) or evidence of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) were found in most of the genomic loci containing the above genes, suggesting that MGEs play an important role in the evolutionary diversification between CAP and non-CAP strains and within CAP clade strains. Our results provide insight into the adaptive strategy and population evolution of endolithic <i>Prosthecochloris</i> strains in coral skeletons.",

A photo-responsive polymer (PRP) was designed for the light-triggered release of CUR with an effective light activation-dependent antimicrobial response. The characterization of the PRP was compared with non-responsive micelles comprising Pluronics&#8482; P123 and F127. According to the findings, the PRP formed photo-responsive micelles in the nanometric scale (&lt; 100&#8201;nm) with a lower critical micelle concentration (3.74&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>-4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>, 5.8&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>-4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>, and 7.2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>-6</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> for PRP, F127, P123, respectively, at 25&#176;C) and higher entrapment efficiency of CUR (88.7, 77.2, and 72.3% for PRP, F127, and P123 micelles, respectively) than the pluronics evaluated. The PRP provided enhanced protection of CUR compared to P123 micelles, as demonstrated in fluorescence quenching studies. The light-triggered release of CUR from PRP occurred with UV light irradiation (at 355&#8201;nm and 25&#8201;mW&#8201;cm<sup>-2</sup>) and a cumulative release of 88.34% of CUR within 1&#8201;h compared to 80% from pluronics after 36&#8201;h. <i>In vitro</i> studies showed that CUR-loaded PRP was non-toxic to mammal cell, showed inactivation of the pathogenic microorganisms <i>Candida albicans</i>, <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, and methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, and decreased biofilm biomass when associated with blue light (455 &#8201;nm, 33.84&#8201;J/cm<sup>2</sup>).

    "original_csv_abstract": "Studies of biogeographic patterns of fungi have long been behind those of plants and animals. The presence of worldwide species, the lack of systematic sampling design and adequate sampling effort, and the lack of research units are responsible for this status. This study investigates the biogeographical patterns of <i>Arthrobotrys oligospora</i>, the most widespread globally distributed nematode-trapping fungi (NTF), by stratified collecting and analyzing 2,250 samples from 228 sites in Yunnan Province, China. The <i>A. oligospora</i> was isolated, and 149 strains were subjected to ITS, TUB, TEF and RPB2 gene sequencing and multi-gene association phylogeographic analysis. The results show that at population level <i>A. oligospora</i> is randomly distributed throughout Yunnan Province and has no biogeographical distribution pattern. At the genetic level, the phylogenetic tree of <i>A. oligospora</i> diverges into five major evolutionary clades, with a low degree of gene flow between the five clades. However, the correlation between the phylogenetic diversity of <i>A. oligospora</i> and geographical factors was low. There was no clear pattern in the phylogenetic clades distribution of <i>A. oligospora</i> either without dividing the study unit or when the grid was used as the study unit. When watersheds were used as the study unit, 67.4%, 63.3%, 65.9%, 83.3%, and 66.7% of clade 1-5 strains were distributed in the Jinsha river, Red river, Peal river, Lancang river, and Nujiang-Irawaddy river watersheds, respectively. The clades distribution of <i>A. oligospora</i> was highly consistent with the watersheds distribution. Training predictions of the clades distributions using randomly generated polygons were also less accurate than watersheds. These results suggest that watersheds are key to discovering the biogeographic distribution patterns of <i>A. oligospora</i>. The <i>A. oligospora</i> populations are blocked by mountains in the watershed, and gene flow barriers have occurred, which may have resulted in the formation of multiple cryptic species. Watersheds are also ideal for understanding such speciation processes, explaining factors affecting biodiversity distribution and coupling studies of plant and animal and microbial diversity.",

It requires more synthetic fertilizers and fungicides during growth and development. However, the excess use of synthetic fertilizers and fungicides causes environmental pollution and affects cane quality and productivity. Plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) indirectly or directly promote plant growth in various ways. In this study, 22 PGPB strains were isolated from the roots of the sugarcane variety GT42. After screening of plant growth-promoting (PGP) traits, it was found that the DJ06 strain had the most potent PGP activity, which was identified as <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) labeling technology confirmed that the DJ06 strain successfully colonized sugarcane tissues. The complete genome sequencing of the DJ06 strain was performed using Nanopore and Illumina sequencing platforms. The results showed that the DJ06 strain genome size was 64,90,034 bp with a G+C content of 66.34%, including 5,912 protein-coding genes (CDSs) and 12 <i>rRNA</i> genes. A series of genes related to plant growth promotion was observed, such as nitrogen fixation, ammonia assimilation, siderophore, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), deaminase, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) production, auxin biosynthesis, phosphate metabolism, hydrolase, biocontrol, and tolerance to abiotic stresses. In addition, the effect of the DJ06 strain was also evaluated by inoculation in two sugarcane varieties GT11 and B8. The length of the plant was increased significantly by 32.43 and 12.66% and fresh weight by 89.87 and 135.71% in sugarcane GT11 and B8 at 60 days after inoculation. The photosynthetic leaf gas exchange also increased significantly compared with the control plants. The content of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) was enhanced and gibberellins (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) were reduced in response to inoculation of the DJ06 strain as compared with control in two sugarcane varieties. The enzymatic activities of oxidative, nitrogen metabolism, and hydrolases were also changed dramatically in both sugarcane varieties with inoculation of the DJ06 strain. These findings provide better insights into the interactive action mechanisms of the <i>P. aeruginosa</i> DJ06 strain and sugarcane plant development.",

The study included 4,682 subjects. Group A had the infection without an anti-S Ig response. Group B and C seroconverted for anti-N Ig between T0 and T1 and between T1 and T2, respectively. Group D was persistently anti-N Ig negative. Group B showed an initial sub-optimal response, reaching the highest titer at T3. Those who received the second dose 120 days after the infection had higher titers compared to those who received it 21 days after the first dose. The immune response depends on the number and the timing of vaccine doses, highlighting the need for a more personalized approach to vaccination.",

Therefore, GNNs are widely used in electronic shopping, drug discovery (especially for the treatment of COVID-19) and other fields, promoting the explosive development of machine learning. However, user interaction, data sharing and circulation are highly sensitive to privacy, and centralized storage can lead to data isolation. Therefore, Federated Learning with high efficiency and strong security and privacy enhancement technology based on secure aggregation can improve the security dilemma faced by GNN. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Secure Aggregation for Federated Graph Neural Network(ESA-FedGNN), which can efficiently reduce the cost of communication and avoid computational redundancy while ensuring data privacy. Firstly, a novel secret sharing scheme based on numerical analysis is proposed, which employs Fast Fourier Transform to improve the computational power of the neural network in sharing phase, and leverages Newton Interpolation method to deal with the disconnection and loss of the client in reconstruction phase. Secondly, a regular graph embedding based on geometric distribution is proposed, which optimizes the aggregation speed by using data parallelism. Finally, a double mask is adopted to ensure privacy and prevent malicious adversaries from stealing model parameters.

There is a growing concern about performing surgery for oligometastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, although there is still little evidence. We reviewed articles published between 2021 and 2022, focusing mainly on surgical outcomes. Furthermore, we summarized the current status of surgery in the multidisciplinary treatment of oligometastatic pancreatic cancer and discuss future perspectives. In liver oligometastasis, multimodal treatment including surgery achieved favorable long-term survival, especially in patients with good responses to preoperative chemotherapy, with a median survival time from 25.5 to 54.6 months. In addition, the data from the National Cancer Database in the United States showed that patients who underwent surgery for oligometastatic liver metastases had a significantly longer overall survival than those who received chemotherapy alone. Prognostic biomarkers were identified, including carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) levels at diagnosis and preoperative chemotherapy with normalization of CA19-9 levels or favorable radiological response. Patients with lung oligometastasis had a more favorable long-term prognosis than those with other recurrence sites, and the updated literature further confirmed the previous studies. Overall survival was favorable, with 84\u2009months after initial surgery and 29.2 months after metastasectomy, and a 5-year survival rate of 60.6% was also reported. In peritoneal oligometastasis, the results of conversion surgery after good responses to preoperative treatment with intraperitoneal therapy or systematic chemotherapy were reported, and the conversion rate and long-term prognosis were favorable. There is a growing concern about performing surgery for oligometastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. We reviewed articles published between 2021 and 2022, focusing mainly on surgical outcomes. Furthermore, we summarize the current status of surgery in multidisciplinary treatment of oligometastatic pancreatic cancer and discuss future perspectives.",

It seems that while the short-term outcomes of minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy (MIE-IL) were better than those of open Ivor Lewis esophagectomy (OE-IL), there were no significant differences in the long-term outcomes between MIE-IL and OE-IL. Similarly, the short-term outcomes of minimally invasive McKeown esophagectomy (MIE-MK) were better than those of open McKeown esophagectomy (OE-MK), while there were no significant differences in the long-term outcomes between MIE-MK and OE-MK. Furthermore, the short-term outcomes of robot-assisted minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy (RAMIE-IL) were superior to those of completely minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy (CMIE-IL). On the other hand, there were advantages and disadvantages in relation to the short-term outcomes of robot-assisted minimally invasive McKeown esophagectomy (RAMIE-MK) as compared with completely minimally invasive McKeown esophagectomy (CMIE-MK). However, there were no significant differences in the long-term outcomes between RAMIE-MK and CMIE-MK. Further research is needed to evaluate of short-term and long-term outcomes of transmediastinal esophagectomy with and without robotic assistance. Both induction chemotherapy and induction chemoradiotherapy appear to be promising to secure a higher rate of conversion surgery. Neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy and chemoimmunoradiotherapy have shown promising results and are expected as new powerful therapies.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "Ethiopia is one of the major origins for international migrants to the Middle East in Africa regardless of the risks and the abuses that migrants face. The study aims to analyse the determinants of international migration of Ethiopians to the Middle East and its impact on the income of households staying behind particularly in the Dessie Zuria district of the Amhara region in Ethiopia. Data were randomly collected from 346 households and analysed using descriptive statistics, logit regression, and Propensity Score Matching (PSM) models. The logit regression analysis indicates that bigger family size, network with migrants/returnees, and the presence of peer/family pressure influence the probability of international migration positively. On the contrary, being a male household head, ownership of larger farmland and livestock, and participation in additional non-farm activities determine international migration negatively. The findings from the PSM model revealed that international migration increased the annual income of migrant-sending households by 13,079.51 ETB per year over non-migrant sending households. However, the benefits enjoyed by the families staying behind have been at the expense of migrants, whose income is hard-earned and they often take a risky route to reach the destination regions. The findings call for an integrated policy approach to control population pressure that depletes the key financial and physical assets of households in the origin and thus forces individuals to look for alternative livelihood strategies such as migration. Location-specific policy interventions are needed to create non-farm and alternative livelihoods, improve agricultural productivity, and access information to reduce exaggerated and misleading information about the destination areas.",

Prognosis of DMG patients remains poor due to the infiltrative nature of these tumors and the protection they receive from systemically delivered therapeutics via an intact blood-brain barrier (BBB), making treatment difficult. While the cell of origin remains disputed, it is believed to reside in the ventral pons. Recent research has pointed toward epigenetic dysregulation inducing an OPC-like transcriptomic signature in DMG cells. This epigenetic dysregulation is typically caused by a mutation (K27M) in one of two histone genes-<i>H3F3A</i> or <i>HIST1H3B</i> -and can lead to a differentiation block that increases these cells oncogenic potential. Standard treatment with radiation is not sufficient at overcoming the aggressivity of this cancer and only confers a survival benefit of a few months, and thus, discovery of new therapeutics is of utmost importance. In this review, we discuss the cell of origin of DMGs, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms that contribute to their aggressivity and resistance to treatment. Additionally, we outline the current standard of care for DMG patients and the potential future therapeutics for this cancer that are currently being tested in preclinical and clinical trials.",

Eight young men with cancer (n = 8, average age = 28 years) were interviewed individually. Two themes emerged from the interviews: (1) trust between nurse and patient is paramount; and (2) this patient population has needs that are not currently being met through the humanistic nursing approach. The results of the iterative qualitative analysis of the data suggest that humanistic nursing tailored to young men with cancer should address their need to express their feelings, to be active and to receive psychological support.",
