    "original_csv_abstract": "Rural connectivity is widely research topic for several years. In India, around 70% of the population have poor or no connectivity to access digital services. Different solutions are being tested and trialled around the world, especially in India. They key driving factor for reducing digital divide is exploring different solutions both technologically and economically to lower the cost for the network deployments and improving service adoption rate. In this survey, we aim to study the rural connectivity use-cases, state of art projects and initiatives, challenges, and technologies to improve digital connectivity in rural parts of India. The strengths and weakness of different technologies which are being tested for rural connectivity is analyzed. We also explore the rural use-case of 6G communication system which would be suitable for rural Indian scenario.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "Automated decision systems (ADS) are increasingly used for consequential decision-making. These systems often rely on sophisticated yet opaque machine learning models, which do not allow for understanding how a given decision was arrived at. In this work, we conduct a human subject study to assess people's perceptions of informational fairness (i.e., whether people think they are given adequate information on and explanation of the process and its outcomes) and trustworthiness of an underlying ADS when provided with varying types of information about the system. More specifically, we instantiate an ADS in the area of automated loan approval and generate different explanations that are commonly used in the literature. We randomize the amount of information that study participants get to see by providing certain groups of people with the same explanations as others plus additional explanations. From our quantitative analyses, we observe that different amounts of information as well as people's (self-assessed) AI literacy significantly influence the perceived informational fairness, which, in turn, positively relates to perceived trustworthiness of the ADS. A comprehensive analysis of qualitative feedback sheds light on people's desiderata for explanations, among which are (i) consistency (both with people's expectations and across different explanations), (ii) disclosure of monotonic relationships between features and outcome, and (iii) actionability of recommendations.",

In a previous work, Khot and Moshkovitz suggested an inefficient candidate reduction (i.e., without a proof of soundness). The current work is the first to provide an efficient reduction along with a proof of soundness. The non-unique game we reduce from is similar to non-unique games for which PCP theorems are known. Our proof relies on a new concentration theorem for functions in Gaussian space that are restricted to a random hyperplane. We bound the typical Euclidean distance between the low degree part of the restriction of the function to the hyperplane and the restriction to the hyperplane of the low degree part of the function.",

Our approach is to compare local structures in the two graphs, matching two nodes if their neighborhoods are 'close enough': for correlated Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graphs, this problem can be locally rephrased in terms of testing whether a pair of branching trees is drawn from either a product distribution, or a correlated distribution. We design an optimal test for this problem which gives rise to a message-passing algorithm for graph alignment, which provably returns in polynomial time a positive fraction of correctly matched vertices, and a vanishing fraction of mismatches. With an average degree $\\lambda = O(1)$ in the graphs, and a correlation parameter $s \\in [0,1]$, this result holds with $\\lambda s$ large enough, and $1-s$ small enough, completing the recent state-of-the-art diagram. Tighter conditions for determining whether partial graph alignment (or correlation detection in trees) is feasible in polynomial time are given in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergences.",

However, these GPS datasets may contain users' private information (e.g., home location), preventing many users from sharing their private information with a third party. Hence, identifying travel modes while protecting users' privacy is a significant issue. To address this challenge, we use federated learning (FL), a privacy-preserving machine learning technique that aims at collaboratively training a robust global model by accessing users' locally trained models but not their raw data. Specifically, we designed a novel ensemble-based Federated Deep Neural Network (eFedDNN). The ensemble method combines the outputs of the different models learned via FL by the users and shows an accuracy that surpasses comparable models reported in the literature. Extensive experimental studies on a real-world open-access dataset from Montr\u00e9al demonstrate that the proposed inference model can achieve accurate identification of users' mode of travel without compromising privacy.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "This paper considers over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL). OTA-FL exploits the superposition property of the wireless medium, and performs model aggregation over the air for free. Thus, it can greatly reduce the communication cost incurred in communicating model updates from the edge devices. In order to fully utilize this advantage while providing comparable learning performance to conventional federated learning that presumes model aggregation via noiseless channels, we consider the joint design of transmission scaling and the number of local iterations at each round, given the power constraint at each edge device. We first characterize the training error due to such channel noise in OTA-FL by establishing a fundamental lower bound for general functions with Lipschitz-continuous gradients. Then, by introducing an adaptive transceiver power scaling scheme, we propose an over-the-air federated learning algorithm with joint adaptive computation and power control (ACPC-OTA-FL). We provide the convergence analysis for ACPC-OTA-FL in training with non-convex objective functions and heterogeneous data. We show that the convergence rate of ACPC-OTA-FL matches that of FL with noise-free communications.",

The mechanism is controlled by tuning parameters, which can be tuned according to a specific risk or utility metric. Thus expected properties of synthetic data sets can be determined analytically a priori, that is, before they are generated. While [4] considered the case of generating m = 1 data set, this paper considers generating m > 1 data sets. In effect, m becomes a tuning parameter and the role of m in relation to the risk-utility trade-off can be shown analytically. The paper introduces a pair of risk metrics, tau(3)(k, d) and tau(4)(k, d), that are suited to m > 1 data sets; and also considers the more general issue of how best to analyse m > 1 categorical data sets: average the data sets pre-analysis or average results post-analysis. Finally, the methods are demonstrated empirically with the synthesis of a constructed data set which is used to represent the English School Census.",

In fact, the possibility of accurately and reliably predicting the RUL of a system, based on a record of its monitoring data, can allow users to schedule maintenance interventions before faults occur. In the recent literature, several data-driven methods for RUL prediction have been proposed. However, most of them are based on traditional (connectivist) neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks, and alternative mechanisms have barely been explored. Here, we tackle the RUL prediction problem for the first time by using a membrane computing paradigm, namely that of Spiking Neural P (in short, SN P) systems. First, we show how SN P systems can be adapted to handle the RUL prediction problem. Then, we propose the use of a neuro-evolutionary algorithm to optimize the structure and parameters of the SN P systems. Our results on two datasets, namely the CMAPSS and new CMAPSS benchmarks from NASA, are fairly comparable with those obtained by much more complex deep networks, showing a reasonable compromise between performance and number of trainable parameters, which in turn correlates with memory consumption and computing time.",

As in the continuous framework, the numerical analysis is based on the reformulation of the PDE system using the set of entropic variables. The equivalence of both schemes allows to establish a discrete entropy inequality and consequently an priori estimates. As a by-product, existence of solutions to the schemes is proved by means of a Leray-Schauder argument.

Among others, it implements the two-photon production of lepton pairs previously introduced in LPAIR. As a proof of principle, we show that the two approaches are numerically consistent. The k(T)-factorized description of this process is also handled, along with the two-photon production of a quark, or a W-+/- gauge boson pair. This toolbox may be used as a common framework for the definition of many other processes following this approach. Additionally, photoproduction and other photon induced processes are also considered, or being implemented. Program summary Program title: CepGen CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/24jg665g65.1 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/cepgen/cepgen Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License 3 Programming language: C++/Python External routines/libraries: GSL [1] for MC integration and histogramming, optional wrappers for LHAPDF [2] for the partonic proton structure functions evaluation, or ROOT [3], Delphes [4] for the output treatment. Nature of problem: The simulation of central exclusive, and in particular two-photon induced processes is becoming increasingly topical given its potential source of contamination for electroweak studies and resonance searches at LHC and future colliders. However, most of simulation tools available are only accounting for the production of photons collinear to the incoming proton beams. Legacy codes such as LPAIR, have however shown their effectiveness in predicting such processes at LHC energies. Unfortunately, they are barely maintained nor maintainable with modern computing infrastructures. Solution method: CepGen provides a modern implementation of legacy photon-induced matrix elements (gamma gamma -> l(+)l(-), and W+ W-, with more to be added), including standard e(+) e(-), or ppbeams (both elastic and dissociative final beam states for the latter). For the modern implementation of LPAIR, it inherits from the former fine treatment of the low-|t| region accounting for a large fraction of the cross section. It also introduces a general wrapping framework to define new photon-induced and diffractive processes, either in C++ or in Fortran. This wrapper provides the k(T) factorization procedure for 2 -> 4 process computation, and a highly flexible 2 -> N process placeholder. A user-defined taming of the matrix element is also included to study the effect of kinematic variables-dependent survival factors observed experimentally.

Humanistic knowledge building communities (HKBCs) are a growth promoting pedagogy, suitable to address these challenges. Yet, the way that students\u2019 identities as knowledge builders are transformed remains undertheorized. In this study, we rise above existing frameworks of fixedness versus fluidity to elucidate how students develop growth orientations. Using a grounded approach, we examined a graduate course, coding 322 relevant utterances that were expressed by the course participants over the semester. This resulted in a five dimensional framework of fixedness versus growth that was used to describe the personal transformation of students within the HKBC. The changes that students made over time were shown to occur at statistically significant levels. This study suggests that learning communities should focus on the complementary nature of collective idea-advancement and personal growth promotion if they are to address the challenges of preparing students for life in a rapidly changing world.",

As such, this study investigated whether LA-enabled group awareness information facilitates wiki-supported collaborative learning in secondary education. We proposed an analytic framework of measures for assessing collaboration quality in a wiki-based collaborative learning environment, covering student contribution, participation, transactivity, and social dynamics. Based on this framework, we designed an LA-enabled group awareness tool, Wikiglass, for use by both teachers and students in K-12 schools for visualizing statistics of students\u2019 input and interactions on wikis at the class, group, and individual levels. Adopting a naturalistic design, this study allowed teachers and students to decide whether and how often to use the tool. System logs from wikis and Wikiglass and interview data were collected from 440 students and six teachers involved in semester-long wiki-supported group inquiry projects in a secondary school. Regression analyses of quantitative data and thematic content analysis of interview responses showed relationships between the frequencies of teachers\u2019 and students\u2019 use of Wikiglass and measures of students\u2019 collaboration quality at both the individual and group levels. These results indicate that teachers\u2019 scaffolding, students\u2019 collaboration styles, and ethical issues must all be considered when implementing collaborative learning approaches for secondary education.

Thus, there is a pressing need for socio-political pedagogies and designs in CSCL to empower students as cultural-historical agents who can communicate and work effectively across different communities. As the initial steps of our larger efforts to conceptualize and operationalize a model of multicultural collaborative competence (MCC), we explore communication patterns associated with productive and dysfunctional shared meaning-making around difficult topics related to identity (e.g., race, gender) during intergroup dialogues in a CSCL context. We also examine how our preexisting, general model of collaborative competence (GCC) aligns with these communication patterns to explore (1) whether GCC is robust enough to capture the socio-political dynamics of difficult dialogues and (2) the ways in which we could modify it to better address the tensions between GCC and MCC goals. We collected the discussion transcripts of four three-person teams over two-time points from an undergraduate Multicultural Psychology course. We first conducted thematic and cross-case analyses to identify the communication patterns and behaviors associated with productive and dysfunctional shared meaning-making processes in the context of difficult dialogues (i.e., MCC). We then employed another set of cross-case analyses to examine the relationship between the multicultural collaborative competencies (MCC) and general collaborative competencies (GCC). We found four main communication patterns associated with MCC: (1) grounding with narratives and aims, (2) exploring differences and commonalities of narratives/perspectives, (3) critical reflection of diverse narratives/perspectives, and (4) providing emotional support to team members. We also found that although the GCC does not cover these communication patterns and associated behaviors, there were some overlaps between the sophistication of multiculturally competent communication patterns and collaboration quality as defined by the GCC.",

A unified framework is provided through a general family of goodness of-fit tests (GGOF) to address this problem. The GGOF family covers many classic and newly developed tests, such as the minimal p-value test, Simes test, the GATES, onesided Kolmogorov-Smirnov type tests, one-sided phi-divergence tests, the generalized Higher Criticism, the generalized Berk-Jones, etc. It is shown that the omnibus test that automatically adapts among GGOF statistics for given data, i.e., the GGOF-O, is still contained in the GGOF family and is computationally efficient. For analytically controlling the type I error rate of any GGOF tests, exact calculation is deduced under the Gaussian model with positive equal correlations. Based on that, the effective correlation coefficient (ECC) algorithm is proposed to address arbitrary correlations. Simulations are used to explore how signal and correlation patterns jointly influence typical GGOF tests' statistical power. The GGOF-O is shown robustly powerful across various signal and correlation patterns. As demonstrated by a study of bone mineral density, the GGOF framework has good potential for detecting novel disease genes in genetic summary data analysis.

The ongoing debate about the concept of statistical significance and the reliability of null hypothesis significance tests (NHST) and p-values has brought the advent of various Bayesian hypothesis tests as possible alternatives, which often employ the Bayes factor. However, careful calibration of the prior parameters is necessary for the type I error rates or power of these alternatives to be any better. Also, the availability of various Bayesian tests for the same statistical problem leads to the question which test to choose based on which criteria. Recently proposed Bayesian nonparametric two-sample tests are analyzed with regard to their type I error rates and power to detect an effect. Results show that approaches vary substantially in their ability to control the type I and II errors, and it is shown how to select the prior parameters to balance power and type I error control. This allows for prior elicitation and power analyses based on objective criteria like type I and II error rates even when conducting a Bayesian nonparametric two-sample test. Also, it is shown that existing nonparametric Bayesian two-sample tests are adequate only to test for location-shifts. Together, the results provide guidance how to perform a nonparametric Bayesian two-sample test while simultaneously improving the reliability of research. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

    "original_csv_abstract": "The modern driver-assistance and autonomous technologies in vehicles increase the ease of driving vehicles. The increased vehicle usage increases the requirement of efficient group communication between the vehicles to support the safety as well as the non-safety applications in Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANET). In VANET, multicast communication is mostly preferred for the effective utilization of computational resources and the attainment of the Quality of Service (QoS). To implement an efficient multicast communication, we need to build and retain a multicast tree. Due to the high mobility and rapid topology changes, the formation and maintenance of a multicast tree are challenging in VANET. Existing multicast communication techniques are either centralized or location-based flooding and suffer from tree reconfiguration overhead. In this paper, a novel Distributed Treebased Multicast Routing (DTMR) algorithm is proposed. During the link failure, the connection is switched to a predetermined and highly stable guardian node. Further, the tree fragmentation and the rejoining delay is reduced in VANET using the proposed algorithm, DTMR. From the simulation results, it is evident that the DTMR achieves a significant performance improvement against the existing multicast techniques such as Distributed Time-limited Reliable Broadcast Incremental Power Strategy (DTRBIP) and Energy Efficient Multicast routing protocol based on Software Defined Networks and Fog computing for Vehicular networks (EEMSFV) in terms of delay, packet loss ratio, scalability, and reliability. In terms of end-to-end delay, packet loss rate, and reliability, the DTMR outperforms the existing DTRBIP and EEMSFV protocols. DTMR achieves 94-96% reliability in highway scenarios and 96-99% reliability in urban environments. Further, as a proof of concept, the proposed, DTMR is implemented and analyzed in real-time. It is found that the real-time experimental results are on par with the simulation results. Hence, the proposed DTMR achieves network stability and reliability in real-time.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "Now a days, emerging trends in the field of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) tend to work on more complex scenarios and flexible network models as the conventional WSN systems that are based on a classical arrangement of sensors. Generally, these networks have different limitations such as control node election, data aggregation, load balancing during data collection etc. The load balancing depends on the effective routing techniques which provide an optimum path to transmit the data such that the minimum amount of energy should be consumed. The control nodes are responsible for assigning the task and data transmission in the cluster-based routing techniques and the selection of the control node is an NP-hard problem. To resolve this problem, an adaptive particle swarm optimization (PSO) ensemble with genetic mutation-based routing is proposed to select control nodes for IoT based software-defined WSN. The proposed algorithm plays a significant role in selecting the control nodes by considering energy and distance parameters. The proposed work is implemented for the heterogeneous networks having different computing power accompanied by single and multiple sinks. The experiment was carried out on the scale of the performance matrix such as fitness value, stability period, average residual energy, etc. The simulation result of the proposed algorithm outperforms over other algorithms under the different arrangements of the network.",

However, they all mainly lack of a serious consideration to eliminate the undesirable row-to-row shading effect of nearby solar panels in instant positioning of a solar panel. The proposed approach presented here smoothly tackles this problem through use of a developed IoT-based STS solution deployed in solar panels in order to increase solar energy harvesting efficiency. A special IoT-STS component designed and implemented with hardware and software, developed for this purpose, effectively transfers the relative panel position information to the other panel IoT-STSs with the help of wireless and internet communication features in real-time. Depending on the array geometry and the steepness of the cross-axis grade, using the proposed backtracking strategy can improve the annual yield up to 5%.",

Therefore, the institutions, which have access to more data can provide better medical services such as more accurate diagnosis. However, privacy is often a bottleneck for IoT healthcare. Users often refuse to provide their health data based on privacy considerations. To balance the requirement of data collection and personal privacy, a lot of privacy preserving data collection schemes are provided. A very important work of these schemes is to produce a secret position for every user to store her/his data, which is named secure arrangement. A novel secure arrangement method is proposed in this paper, which is based on matrix eigenvalue calculation. Compared with the current secure arrangement methods, the proposed method is more robust and efficient, which drives the proposed scheme to be more suitable for repeated aggregation. Then we use an example to illustrate how to use the proposed arrangement method to construct a privacy data collection protocol. We prove the proposed scheme is secure and efficient in security analysis and efficiency analysis.",

A map is called semi-equivelar if the cyclic arrangement of faces around each vertex is same. In general, semi-equivelar maps on a surface form a bigger class than vertex-transitive maps. There are semi-equivelar maps on the torus, the Klein bottle and other surfaces which are not vertex-transitive. It is known that the boundaries of Platonic solids, Archimedean solids, regular prisms and anti-prisms are vertex-transitive maps on S-2. Here we show that there is exactly one semi-equivelar map on S-2 which is not vertex-transitive. As a consequence, we show that all the semi-equivelar maps on RP2 are vertex-transitive. Moreover, every semi-equivelar map on S-2 can be geometrized, i.e., every semi-equivelar map on S-2 is isomorphic to a semi-regular tiling of S-2. In the course of the proof of our main result, we present a combinatorial characterisation in terms of an inequality of all the types of semi-equivelar maps on S-2.

Two simple measures are defined-rooted depth and relative depth-and their properties are discussed. The method of loop collapse is introduced, allowing investigation of networks containing directed cycles. The behavior of the two depth measures is investigated in Erdos-Renyi random graphs, directed Barabasi-Albert networks, and in Gnutella p2p share network. A clear distinction in the behavior between non-hierarchical and hierarchical networks is found, with random graphs featuring unimodal distribution of depths dependent on arc density, while for hierarchical systems the distributions are similar for different network densities. Relative depth shows the same behavior as existing trophic level measure for tree-like networks, but is only statistically correlated for more complex topologies, including acyclic directed graphs.",

In particular, the same data streams, sampled and stored differently, may cause agents to arrive at different conclusions and to take different actions. This phenomenon has a drastic impact on polities-populations of agents predicated on the sharing of information. We show that, even under ideal conditions, polities consisting of epistemic agents with heterogeneous cognitive architectures might not achieve consensus concerning what conclusions to draw from datastreams. Transfer entropy applied to a toy model of a polity is analyzed to showcase this effect when the dynamics of the environment is known. As an illustration where the dynamics is not known, we examine empirical data streams relevant to climate and show the consensus problem manifest.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "News and social media play an important role in public political discourse. It is not clear what quantifiable relationships public discussions of politics have with official discourse within legislative bodies. In this study we present an analysis of how language used by Members of Parliament (MPs) in the United Kingdom (UK) changes after social media posts and online reactions to those posts. We consider three domains: news articles posted on Facebook in the UK, speeches in the questions-debates in the UK House of Commons, and Tweets by UK MPs. Our method works by quantifying how the words used in one domain become more common in another domain after an event such as a social media post. Our results show that words used in one domain later appear more commonly in other domains. For instance after each article on Facebook, we estimate that on average 4 in 100,000 words in Commons speeches had changed, becoming more similar to the language in the article. We also find that the extent of this language change positively correlates with the number of comments and emotional interactions on Facebook. The observed language change differs between political parties; in particular, changes in word use by Labour MPs are more strongly related to social media content than that of Conservative MPs. We argue that the magnitude of this word flow is quite substantial given the large volume of news articles shared on Facebook. Our method and results quantify how parliamentary attention follows public interest as expressed on Facebook and also indicate how this effect may be stronger for posts which evoke reactions on Facebook associated with laughter or anger.",

We propose a multi-objective NAS method based on Cartesian genetic programming for evolving convolutional neural networks (CNN). The method allows approximate operations to be used in CNNs to reduce the power consumption of a target hardware implementation. During the NAS process, a suitable CNN architecture is evolved together with selecting approximate multipliers to deliver the best trade-offs between accuracy, network size, and power consumption. The most suitable 8 \u00d7 N-bit approximate multipliers are automatically selected from a library of approximate multipliers. Evolved CNNs are compared with CNNs developed by other NAS methods on the CIFAR-10 and SVHN benchmark problems.",

PSB1 has been used to make notable progress toward the goal of general program synthesis: automatically creating the types of software that human programmers code. Many of the systems that have attempted the problems in PSB1 have used it to demonstrate performance improvements granted through new techniques. Over time, the suite has gradually become outdated, hindering the accurate measurement of further improvements. The field needs a new set of more difficult benchmark problems to move beyond what was previously possible and ensure that systems do not overfit to one benchmark suite. In this paper, we describe the 25 new general program synthesis benchmark problems that make up PSB2, a new benchmark suite. These problems are curated from a variety of sources, including programming katas and college courses. We selected these problems to be more difficult than those in the original suite, and give results using PushGP showing this increase in difficulty. We additionally give an example of benchmarking using a state-of-the-art parent selection method, showing improved performance on PSB2 while still leaving plenty of room for improvement. These new problems will help guide program synthesis research for years to come.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "In some situations, the interpretability of the machine learning models plays a role as important as the model accuracy. Interpretability comes from the need to trust the prediction model, verify some of its properties, or even enforce them to improve fairness. Many model-agnostic explanatory methods exists to provide explanations for black-box models. In the regression task, the practitioner can use white-boxes or gray-boxes models to achieve more interpretable results, which is the case of symbolic regression. When using an explanatory method, and since interpretability lacks a rigorous definition, there is a need to evaluate and compare the quality and different explainers. This paper proposes a benchmark scheme to evaluate explanatory methods to explain regression models, mainly symbolic regression models. Experiments were performed using 100 physics equations with different interpretable and non-interpretable regression methods and popular explanation methods, evaluating the performance of the explainers performance with several explanation measures. In addition, we further analyzed four benchmarks from the GP community. The results have shown that Symbolic Regression models can be an interesting alternative to white-box and black-box models that is capable of returning accurate models with appropriate explanations. Regarding the explainers, we observed that Partial Effects and SHAP were the most robust explanation models, with Integrated Gradients being unstable only with tree-based models. This benchmark is publicly available for further experiments.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "Deep Learning has been very successful in automating the feature engineering process, widely applied for various tasks, such as speech recognition, classification, segmentation of images, time-series forecasting, among others. Deep neural networks (DNNs) incorporate the power to learn patterns through data, following an end-to-end fashion and expand the applicability in real world problems, since less pre-processing is necessary. With the fast growth in both scale and complexity, a new challenge has emerged regarding the design and configuration of DNNs. In this work, we present a study on applying an evolutionary grammar-based genetic programming algorithm (GP) as a unified approach to the design of DNNs. Evolutionary approaches have been growing in popularity for this subject as Neuroevolution is studied more. We validate our approach in three different applications: the design of Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification, Graph Neural Networks for text classification, and U-Nets for image segmentation. The results show that evolutionary grammar-based GP can efficiently generate different DNN architectures, adapted to each problem, employing choices that differ from what is usually seen in networks designed by hand. This approach has shown a lot of promise regarding the design of architectures, reaching competitive results with their counterparts.",

We develop a general methodology for determining whether a given risk-measurement-related optimization problem is robust, which we call \"robustness against optimization.\" The new notion is studied for various classes of risk measures and expected utility and loss functions. Motivated by practical issues from financial regulation, special attention is given to the two most widely used risk measures in the industry, Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES). We establish that for a class of general optimization problems, VaR leads to nonrobust optimizers, whereas convex risk measures generally lead to robust ones. Our results offer extra insight on the ongoing discussion about the comparative advantages of VaR and ES in banking and insurance regulation. Our notion of robustness is conceptually different from the field of robust optimization, to which some interesting links are derived.",

In this paper, a GRASP-based state-of-the-art heuristic for the minimum latency problem is improved by means of data mining techniques. Computational experiments showed that the hybrid heuristic with data mining was able to match or improve the solution quality for a large number of instances, together with a substantial reduction of running time.

    "original_csv_abstract": "In recent research works, morphing wings were studied as an interesting field for a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The previous studies either focused on selecting suitable material for the morphing wings or performing experimental tests on UAVs with morphing wings. Though, the dynamic modeling of active flexible morphing wings and their involved interactions with the aerodynamics of the UAV body are challenging subjects. Using such a model to control a small UAV to perform specific maneuvering is not investigated yet. The dynamic model of UAV with active morphing wings generates a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system which rises the difficulty of the control system design. In this paper, the aeroelastic dynamic model of morphing wing activated by piezocomposite actuators is established using the finite element method and modal decomposition technique. Then, the dynamic model of the UAV is developed taking into consideration the coupling between the wing and piezocomposite actuators, as well as the dynamic properties of the morphing actuators with the aerodynamic wind disturbances. A model predictive control (MPC) is designed for the MIMO control system to perform specific flight maneuvering by tracking desired trajectories of UAV altitude and yaw angle. Additionally, the MPC achieves constrained behavior of pitch and roll angles to get satisfactory UAV motion. Also, the behaviors of the UAV control system using MPC are evaluated after adding Dryden wind turbulence to the UAV outputs. Finally, a UAV flight simulation is conducted which shows that the control system successfully rejects the applied disturbances and tracks the reference trajectories with acceptable behavior of pitch and roll angles.",

The high-level task planner is a Reinforcement Learning agent, trained using the information coming from the low-level Motion Planner. In this work we consider the Q-Tree algorithm, which is based on a dynamic tree structure inspired by the Q-learning technique.

Although aerial inspection of transmission lines is a well-researched topic, there is still space for research papers and solutions that focus on shared control, landing, and experimental evaluation of the solutions. This kind of system has the capabilities to acquire and process information about its surrounding. By employing automatic UAVs embedded with artificial intelligence, industries, business and researchers can significantly improve their visual-based inspection routines, bringing safety to the user and processing reliable information. Therefore, this research work proposes a strategy to both detect and track power transmission lines and a method to allow assistive control during UAV landing. Both methods were evaluated in simulated and real-world scenarios. Regarding the detection and tracking strategies, the outcomes suggested that the proposed system is capable of correctly identifying power transmission lines and navigating above them, even in the presence of cluttered backgrounds. Futhermore, the results of the assisted landing strategy showed that the method has excellent performance and is technically viable for practical deployment.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "Problem definition: We consider capacity sharing through demand allocation among firms with multiple demand sources and multiple service facilities. Firms decide on the allocation of demand from different sources to different facilities to minimize delay costs and service-fulfillment costs possibly subject to service-level requirements. If firms decide to operate collectively as a coalition, they must also decide on a scheme for sharing the total cost. Academic/practical relevance: We study capacity sharing through demand allocation in service systems in the presence of service-fulfillment costs. Our problem is motivated by service collaboration in healthcare involving public-private partnerships. Methodology: We formulate the problem as a cooperative game and identify a cost allocation that is in the core. Results: The cost-allocation scheme we identify is price-directed, and the cost of each firm consists of three components: (1) the delay cost incurred within the firm; (2) a cost paid for the capacity used by the firm at facilities owned by other firms; and (3) a payment received for fulfilling demand of other firms at facilities owned by the firm. Interestingly, we show that the cost-allocation scheme is equivalent to a market equilibrium-that is, it can be implemented in a decentralized fashion. We extend our analysis to settings where the capacity of each facility is endogenously determined and to settings where a service-priority policy is deployed. Our results are robust to a variety of generalizations: partial sharing, partial transfer, facilities modeled as general queueing systems, and convex delay costs. Managerial implications: Our findings provide guidelines for and insights into how to carry out demand allocation and cost sharing among different firms in the presence of service-fulfillment costs to foster service collaboration. In particular, the equilibrium market prices can be viewed as the prices/subsidies for service collaboration in a public-private partnership.",

The framework extracts advantages from different designs in the literature and integrates them into the inpainting network. We apply region normalization to generate coarse blur results with the correct structure. Then, contextual attention is applied to utilize the texture information of background regions to generate the final result. Although using region normalization can improve the performance and quality of the network, it often results in visible color shifts. To solve this problem, we introduce perceptual color distance in the loss function. In quantitative comparison experiments, the proposed method is superior to the existing similar methods in Inception Score, Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance, and perceptual color distance. In qualitative comparison experiments, the proposed method can effectively resolve the problem of color shifts.",

Unlike most of the structural models used in the literature, our new model assumes that the default will occur only if the price of the reference asset stays below a certain level for a pre-described period of time. To work out the corresponding CDS price, a general pricing formula containing the unknown no-default probability is derived first. It is then shown that the determination of such a probability is equivalent to the valuation of a Parisian or Parasian down-and-out binary options, depending on how the time is recorded. After the option price is solved with a theta finite difference scheme, the CDS price is obtained through the derived general pricing formula. Finally, some numerical experiments are carried out to study the effects of the new default mechanics on the CDS prices.",

At the same time, the models of information diffusion on the Internet are changing as well. However, these models experience the problem due to the fast development of network technologies. There is no thorough research in regards to the latest models and their applications and advantages. As a result, it is essential to have a comprehensive study of information diffusion models. The primary goal of this research is to provide a comparative study on the existing models such as the Ising model, Sznajd model, SIR model, SICR model, Game theory and social networking services models. We discuss several of their applications with the existing limitations and further categorizations. Vulnerabilities and privacy challenges of information diffusion models are extensively explored. Furthermore, categorization including strengths and weaknesses are discussed. Finally, limitations and recommendations are suggested with diverse solutions for the improvement of the information diffusion models and envisioned future research directions. (c) 2019 The Authors.

In this paper, the authors first provided a comprehensive analysis on the IoT communication strategies and applications for smart devices based on a systematic literature review. Then, the communication strategies and applications are categorized into four main topics including device-to-device, device-to-cloud, device-to-gateway, and device-to-application scenarios. Furthermore, a technical taxonomy is presented to classify the existing papers according to search-based methodology in the scientific databases. The technical taxonomy presents five categories for IoT communication applications including monitoring-based communications, routing-based communications, health-based communications, intrusion-based communications, and resource-based communications. The evaluation factors and infrastructure attributes are discussed based on some technical questions. Finally, some new challenges and forthcoming issues of future IoT communications are presented.",

The proposed HCNB, which is designed by combining the Holoentropy function with the correlative based Naive Bayes classifier deals with both high-dimensional data sets as well as extensive datasets to improve the benchmark, and classify the data based on dependent assumption. Therefore, the proposed HCNB-MRM is used to make the process simpler and to choose the best features from big dataset. The proposed HCNB with the MapReduce Model maximizes the performance of big data classification using probability index table, and posterior probability of the testing data samples. The performance of the proposed HCNB-MRM is evaluated using three metrics, such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. From the experimental results, it is analyzed that the proposed HCNB-MRM obtains a high classification accuracy of 93.5965% and 94.3369% for the localization dataset, and skin dataset when compared with the existing techniques.",

Through a simulation study, we investigate the run-length distribution of the proposed chart. The performance comparison study shows that the CMP-PM chart outperforms the Sellers, the GEWMA and the mu-CUSUM charts at almost all levels of shifts for both over- and under-dispersed data.

Just as the interaction between magnetic materials are due to the magnetic field around the magnet contacting another magnet, between the quanta can also interact with each other through magnetic fields. Through the study of quantum mechanics and related theories of brain science, the article puts forward the following viewpoints: between quantum, which has entanglement state, cannot only interact through magnetic fields but also generate quantum induction fields to generate quantum induction waves. The entangled quantum generated spin waves are connected to each other based on quantum inductive waves to form a quantum inductive network. Then, the information is transmitted through resonance to realize the communication between all things. Thus, all things in the universe can be interconnected based on quantum entanglement effects. By analyzing the construction mode of the internet network, the paper proposes the architecture of the quantum induction communication system and the basic topology of a quantum induction internet network. Several thought experiment schemes were designed, and the information transmission between the ordinary objects and between the people and ordinary objects is studied as an example. The analysis points out the main problems faced by the construction of the quantum induction internet. It points out that the significance of constructing of the network of All things interconnect based on quantum entanglement effect is that all living bodies and nonliving bodies in the heaven and earth can be connected and communicate with each other.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "Deploying user data or programs in cloud risks divulging their privacy because the cloud-side supervisors, such as system administrators, can leverage the higher privilege to snoop the user data. Based on the trusted execution environment (TEE) technology, Intel Software Guard eXtension (SGX) is a practical remedy to user privacy, which employs hardware-assisted enclave to wrap the sensitive data, preventing them from the disclosure. However, the application performance is hurt due to the CPU-expensive and frequent operations on the enclave creation and destruction. In this paper, we propose SGXPool, an application-level framework of resource management to relieve the above issue. SGXPool first uses a preallocated resource pool to assign/revoke the enclave on demand and avoids its cost of dynamical creation and destruction. Then, SGXPool utilizes another resource pool to constrain the threading overhead such as thread initialization, scheduling, and destruction. In addition, SGXPool exposes the simple and clear interface, allowing users or programmers to apply SGXPool without any intrusive modifications on the original SGX application. We implement SGXPool in the typical web servers which use the multithreading to handle the concurrent user requests. The evaluation results show that SGXPool can improve the performance of the original multithreading system up to 19 times. Meanwhile, the original security of SGX is maintained.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "Mobile edge computing (MEC) enables computing services at the network edge closer to mobile users (MUs) to reduce network transmission latency and energy consumption. Deploying edge computing servers in small base stations (SBSs), operators make profit by offering MUs with computing services, while MUs purchase services to solve their own computation tasks quickly and energy-efficiently. In this context, it is of particular importance to optimize computing resource allocation and computing service pricing in each SBS, subject to its limited computing and communication resources. To address this issue, we formulate an optimization problem of computing resource management and trading in small-cell networks and tackle this problem using a two-tier matching. Specifically, the first tier targets at the association algorithm between MUs and SBSs to achieve maximum social welfare, and the second tier focuses on the collaboration algorithm among SBSs to make efficient usage of limited computing resources. We further show that the two proposed algorithms contribute to stable matchings and achieve weak Pareto optimality. In particular, we verify that the first algorithm arrives at a competitive equilibrium. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms can achieve a better network social welfare than baseline algorithms while retaining a close-optimal performance.",

Accordingly, this paper introduces the trust-based topology-hiding multipath routing algorithm for the MANET. The proposed model finds the security factor of each node in the MANET, and the neighbor nodes are selected based on the defined security factor. The proposed routing method has four models for defining the security factor, namely the trusted model, energy model, delay model, and the mobility model. The proposed multipath routing determines the secured route between the sender and receiver based on the selected neighbor nodes. Finally, data communication is performed through the selected multipath. The performance of the proposed multipath routing is analyzed with the existing methods, such as topology-hiding multipath routing protocol, Fractional lion optimization to topology-hiding multi-path routing, and Adaptive Fractional lion optimization to topology-hiding multi-path routing for the performance metrics, such as throughput, delay, energy, and packet drop rate (PDR). Simulation results show that the proposed multipath routing has the better values of 0.330566, 0.376754, 0.319369, and 0.380559 after 50 s of simulation for throughput, delay, energy, and PDR than the existing models when there is an attack on the node.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "In public vehicles, one of the major concerns is driver's level of expertise for its direct proportionality to safety of passengers. Hence, before a driver is subjected to certain type of vehicle, he should be thoroughly evaluated and categorized with respect to certain parameters instead of only one-time metric of having driving license. These aspects may be driver's expertise, vigilance, aptitude, experience years, cognition, driving style, formal education, terrain, region, minor violations, major accidents, and age group. The purpose of this categorization is to ascertain suitability of a driver for certain vehicle type(s) to ensure passengers' safety. Currently, no driver categorization technique fully comprehends the implicit as well as explicit characteristics of drivers dynamically. In this paper, machine learning-based dynamic and adaptive technique named D-CHAITs (driver categorization through hybrid of artificial intelligence techniques) is proposed for driver categorization with an objective focus on driver's attributes modeled in DriverOntology. A supervised mode of learning has been employed on a labeled dataset, having diverse profiles of drivers with attributes pertinent to drivers' perspectives of demographics, behaviors, expertise, and inclinations. A comparative analysis of D-CHAIT with three other machine learning techniques (fuzzy logic, case-based reasoning, and artificial neural networks) is also presented. The efficacy of all techniques was empirically measured while categorizing the drivers based on their profiles through metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure performance, and associated costs. These empirical quantifications assert D-CHAIT as a better technique than contemporary ones. The novelty of proposed technique is signified through preprocessing of feature attributes, quality of data, training of machine learning model on more relevant data, and adaptivity.",

Consequently, system losses are continually raised while the voltage profile is reduced. This paper presents a novel hybrid method to determine the best locations and sizes of single and multiple of different renewable distributed energy resources (DER). The presented hybrid method is based on Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) and combined power loss sensitivity (CPLS). Integration of photovoltaics (PV) and wind turbines (WT) in distribution network is used to enhance the system voltage, minimize system losses and increase the system capacity. The effect of annual load growth in system load and system operating constraints are taken in consideration. IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus radial distribution systems (RDS) are used to validate the presented algorithm for integrating the DERS in distribution system. In addition, the presented algorithm is compared with different recent optimization algorithms in order to prove its effectiveness and superiority. (c) 2019 The Authors.

    "original_csv_abstract": "With edge computing-based Internet-of-Things environments widely recognized, major software technologies are rapidly integrated. Among the various areas of such technologies, software evolution and maintenance are essential yet challenging tasks both for research and in practice. In particular, for large-scale software, the maintenance costs are often much more than the development cost. In order to help to resolve this issue, software module clustering approaches have been studied to build adequate modules with high cohesion and low coupling; such modular structures can help the comprehension and maintenance of complex systems. The existing studies apply either structural, semantic, or historic-based factors as clustering criteria; however, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study considers Graphical User Interface (GUI) as a factor for software module clustering. Because GUI is linked to the functionalities of a software system, it can be a useful source to find cohesive modules and generate well-defined modular structures. Thus, in this study, we propose a GUI-based approach for software module clustering to improve the quality of software modularization. Quantitative and qualitative experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach and comparing it with three existing approaches; using two open source software systems. The evaluation results show that our proposed approach generates feasible software modules and provides closer estimates to actual modularization than those of the existing approaches.",

An optimal replacement policy has been derived, and effect of measurement errors on the mean square error of the estimator has been studied. Empirical studies have been carried out using both real and simulated data, and suitable recommendations have been put forward to the survey statisticians for applications in real life problems.",

Because of the mobile nature of the UE, the D2D link tends to fail more often. In order to guarantee seamless proximity service (ProSe) continuity for the mobile devices, a competent mobility management technique is necessary. In this work, an optimal D2D handover (HO) scheme in LTE heterogeneous network is proposed for guaranteeing seamless ProSe continuity for the UE in D2D communication. The proposed optimal D2D HO scheme tries to improve the duration of D2D communication by not only considering the signal quality between the D2D UE pairs but also the distance between them. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves the D2D mode duration, even in high mobility, thereby reducing frequent HO of the D2D UE, which is in D2D communication.",

However, the nature of the Arabic cursive script poses extra challenges that need further investigation. Therefore, having a reliable and efficient Arabic OCR system that is independent of font variations is highly required. In this paper, an indirect, font-in dependent word and character segmentation algorithm for printed Arabic text investigated. The proposed algorithm takes a binary line image as an input and produces a set of binary images consisting of one character or ligature as an output. The segmentation performed at two levels: a word segmentation performed in the first level, by employing a vertical projection at the input line image along with using Interquartile Range (IQR) method to differentiate between word gaps and within word gaps. A projection profile method used as a second level of segmentation along with a set of statistical and topological features, which are font-independent, to identify the correct segmentation points from all potential points. The APTI dataset used to test the proposed algorithm with a variety of font type, size, and style. The algorithm experimented on 1800 lines (approximately 24,816 words) with an average accuracy of 97.7% for words segmentation and 97.51% for characters segmentation. (c) 2019 The Authors.

Each modality is separately processed to generate a vector of scores. The fusion method is applied at the score level. A preliminary study based on the k-means clustering method, for each modality, led us to split the score range into three zones of interest relevant to the proposed identification method. The fusion is then applied to the extracted regions using two approaches. The first one achieves the classification by the decision tree combined to the weighted sum (BCC), while the second approach is based on the fuzzy logic (BFL). Several tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods on standard biometric databases using four metrics, namely, False Accept Rate, False Reject Rate, Enrollee False Accept Rate and Recognition Rate. The obtained results are very interesting since they illustrate clearly that the proposed fusion approaches outperform those based on a single modality. In addition, we showed that the BCC fusion approach achieves slightly better performance compared to the BFL. (c) 2019 The Authors.

The Bayes estimators are derived with gamma prior and evaluated under squared error loss function. It is known that the censored observations create the complexity in Bayes estimation procedures. Therefore, two approximation techniques, namely Tierney-Kadane approximation method and Markov Chain Monte Carlo method have been used to compute the approximate Bayes estimators. The proposed estimates are compared with the usual maximum likelihood estimators through Monte Carlo simulations. Lastly, a medical data set has been considered to show the applicability of the proposed model as well study in real life scenario.",

Pushing the intelligence to the network edge, this framework extracts features per network flow to identify the source, the type of the generated traffic, and to detect network attacks. Different machine learning algorithms are compared with random forest, which gives the best results: Up to 94.5% accuracy for device-type identification, up to 93.5% accuracy for traffic-type classification, and up to 97% accuracy for abnormal traffic detection.",

On the other hand, even though distance and online learning has become mainstream, there are still concerns leveled at many of these educational offerings, one of them being the relative social isolation of online and distance students. In this study, we investigate if and how ambient awareness, a concept originated in research in interpersonal effects of SNS, can play an important role in how salient social impressions of peers emerge and how this leads to perceptions of social presence among students. To this end, we use an impression formation paradigm in a four-week online distance course (N = 51). We found that students were able to form impressions of their peers through ambient awareness. These impressions differed in prevalence from the ones gathered through direct social interaction. In a larger second sample (N = 169), we find ambient awareness to be a mediator between the sociability of the learning environment and perceptions of social presence. Implications, limitations and suggestions for further research are discussed.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "As the global data traffic has significantly increased in the recent year, the ultra-dense deployment of cellular networks (UDN) is being proposed as one of the key technologies in the fifth-generation mobile communications system (5G) to provide a much higher density of radio resource. The densification of small base stations could introduce much higher inter-cell interference and lead user to meet the edge of coverage more frequently. As the current handover scheme was originally proposed for macro BS, it could cause serious handover issues in UDN i.e. ping-pong handover, handover failures and frequent handover. In order to address these handover challenges and provide a high quality of service (QoS) to the user in UDN. This paper proposed a novel handover scheme, which integrates both advantages of fuzzy logic and multiple attributes decision algorithms (MADM) to ensure handover process be triggered at the right time and connection be switched to the optimal neighbouring BS. To further enhance the performance of the proposed scheme, this paper also adopts the subtractive clustering technique by using historical data to define the optimal membership functions within the fuzzy system. Performance results show that the proposed handover scheme outperforms traditional approaches and can significantly minimise the number of handovers and the ping-pong handover while maintaining QoS at a relatively high level.",

The results show that the concepts of \"evaluate\" (31.52%) and \"analyze\" (27.77%) were the two most frequent behaviors in the Bloom's Taxonomy. The \"remember\" and \"evaluate\" were the significant starting behaviors for all of the students; \"remember\" and \"evaluate\" were the significant starting behaviors for the intuitive-style students, while \"understand\" was a significant starting behavior for the analytical-style students. This confirms that the students with different cognitive styles implemented multiple strategies for learning. It is also found that the flipped learning promoted the students' achievement.

With a better document clustering approach, computers can organize a document corpus automatically to a meaningful cluster for enabling efficient navigation, and browsing of the corpus. Document navigation and browsing is a valuable complement to the deficiencies of information retrieval technologies. This paper introduces Modsup-based frequent itemset and Rider Optimization-based Moth Search Algorithm (Rn-MSA) for clustering the documents. At first, the input documents are given to the pre-processing step, and then, the extraction is carried out based on TF-IDF and Wordnet features. Once the extraction is done, the feature selection is carried out based on frequent itemset for the establishment of feature knowledge. At last, the document clustering is done using the proposed Rn-MSA, which is designed by combining Rider Optimization Algorithm (ROA), and the Moth Search Algorithm (MSA). The performance of the document clustering based on proposed Modsup\u202f+\u202fRn-MSA is evaluated in terms of precision, recall, F-Measure, and accuracy. The developed document clustering method achieves the maximal precision of 95.90%, maximal recall of 96.41%, maximal F-Measure of 96.41%, and the maximal accuracy of 95.12% that indicates its superiority.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "In the last decade, Diaz-Garcia and Leiva-Sanchez (2005, 2007) proposed a generalized Birnbaum-Saunders distribution based on elliptically contoured distributions. A special case of this generalization is Student's t Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. This flexible lifetime distribution generalizes both the Cauchy Birnbaum-Saunders distribution and the two-parameter Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. In this comparison paper, we discuss maximum likelihood estimation methods for the parameters of this distribution. We numerically illustrate and examine the performances of all discussed methods using extensive Monte Carlo simulations and illustrative examples. Furthermore, we analyze real-life data to assess the practical usage of the considered generalized family of distributions, and to illustrate the discussed estimation methods.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "In the gray prediction, the GM(1,1) model has been applied widely, but the conventional GM(1,1) model prediction shows big errors sometimes. Many researchers improve prediction accuracy by changing the basic structure of model. The paper tries to make improvements in the models parameter estimation on the basis of new background value optimization without changing the models structure, and gives the following four methods: (1) estimating the parameter of gray model GM(1,1) with the optimized value of exponential curve as the background value; (2) estimating the parameter of gray model GM(1,1) with the optimized value of power function curve as the background value; (3) estimating the parameter of gray model GM(1,1) with the optimized value of polynomial curve as the background value; (4) estimating the parameter of gray model GM(1,1) with the optimized value of interpolation function as the background value. The last part of the paper builds the GM(1,1) model of China's total clean energy consumption with the four improved methods. The simulation and prediction results show that these methods all improve the prediction accuracy of model significantly.",

The estimation of the parameters of the zero-inflated hyper-Poisson distribution is attempted. The distribution has been fitted to certain real life data sets and thereby shown that the proposed model gives better fit to the data sets compared to existing models such as zero-inflated Poisson distibution (ZIPD), zero-inflated negative binomial distribution (ZINBD), zero-inflated Conway-Maxwell Poisson distribution (ZICMPD), and zero-inflated generalized Poisson distribution (ZIGPD). Further, Rao's efficient score test procedure is applied for examining the significance of the parameters and a simulation study is carried out for assessing the performance of the maximum likelihood estimators of the parameters of the distribution.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "Traffic prediction with high accuracy has become a vital and challenging issue for resource management in cloud computing. It should be noted that one of the prominent factors in resource management is accurate traffic prediction based on a few data points and within a short time period. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is a suitable model to predict traffic in short time periods. However, it requires a massive amount of historical data to achieve accurate results. On the other hand, the fuzzy regression model is adequate for prediction using less historical data. Aforementioned by these considerations, in this paper, a combination of ARIMA and fuzzy regression called fuzzy autoregressive integrated moving average (FARIMA) is used to forecast traffic in cloud computing. Besides, we adopt the FARIMA model by using the sliding window, called SOFA, concept to determine models with higher prediction accuracy. Accuracy comparison of these models based on the root means square error and coefficient of determination demonstrates that SOFA is about 5.4 and 0.009, respectively, which is the superior model for traffic prediction.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "Smart cities are one of the promising application areas where the energy management (supply/dispatch) issues have the potential to positively affect the society. In the common era of information and technology, the consumers expect the required amount of energy to be present at anytime. This energy is obtained through renewable and nonrenewable resources. Smart wind energy is the idea of efficient energy generation utilizing the wind while satisfying green expectations. However, the random characteristics caused by various external factors have significant effects on wind speeds, thus introducing difficulties in power systems operations and energy generation. Forecasting techniques can be effectively used to predict future wind speeds and power generation to optimize the energy output. The objective of this study is to provide a framework for a local smart-city wind energy harvesting model. Our study evaluates wind speed forecasting models based on synced weather characteristics (air temperature, humidity, and pressure), against models based on wind speed data itself. The produced models are implemented via k-nearest neighbors and linear regression. Two different data sets are addressed for performance comparison purposes. The first one is 5 years of 10-minute time span measurements at Middle East Technical University campus. The second data set is 3 years of the same time span at a site in California, USA. The accuracy of predictions is found to be higher for the data sets with lower variance (METU data set). However, the models fit the higher variance (NREL data set) data better than the lower one.",

Resource allocation plays a major role in load balancing. In this scheduling problem, independent task in cloud computing can allocate resource by the summary of modified canopy fuzzy c-means algorithm (MCFCMA). To allocate task to their corresponding resource, particle swarm-based optimization algorithm (PSO) is used. In proposed scheme, first independent task selected based on load feed-back, cluster the requested task using MCFCMA and schedule task to each virtual machine. VM selects parallel execution in virtual machine manager. Calculate feature value using PSO algorithm. Allocate resource to the task. Since our proposed system selects resource based on parallel execution, it reduces load balancing in Cloud Quantum Computation (CQC). The proposed system overcomes issues in load balancing and load scheduling; this can be proved by its precision and privacy calculation.",

Critical values are obtained with the Monte Carlo method for sample sizes and at a significance level The power of several normality tests for a wide collection of alternative distributions is calculated. Alternative distributions are divided into 12 groups according to their skewness and excess kurtosis. The second aim is to propose a similarity measure between the normal distribution and an alternative distribution. The third aim is to propose two new alternative distributions created in order to obtain the desired values of skewness and excess kurtosis.

ELM-based RNNs solve our problem of determining the number of hidden layers and the learning algorithm is also faster than gradient-descent based RNN. The problem of identifying the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer can be solved by Garson algorithm.

Consequently, testing the validity of the normality assumption is an integral part of such statistical analyses. Here, we investigate twelve currently available tests for normality using Monte-Carlo simulation. Alternative distributions are used to calculate the empirical power of the tests studied here. The distributions considered arise from three different categories: symmetric short-tailed, symmetric long-tailed and asymmetric. In addition, power is calculated for several contaminated alternatives. As a direct consequence of this study, we recommend a two-tier approach: (i) observe the shape of the empirical data distribution using graphical methods, then (ii) select an appropriate test based on the likely distributional shape and the corresponding sample size. In general, with respect to power considerations, it is observed that for asymmetric distributions, the Shapiro-Wilk and Ryan-Joiner tests perform fairly well for all sample sizes studied here. Additionally, the Jarque-Bera, Modified Jarque-Bera, and Ryan-Joiner tests perform fairly well for contaminated normal distributions. The popular methods available in current software packages, such as the Shapiro-Wilk test, the Ryan-Joiner Normality test, and the Anderson-Darling goodness of test, work at least moderately well for most of the cases we considered.",

To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed GIM, 48 Grade 4 students from two classess were recruited from an elementary school in Taoyuan City, Taiwan, to participate in an instruction experiment. Two classess were randomly assigned to the experimental group using CPBL with the proposed GIM and the control group using CPBL with the individual incentive mechanism (IIM) to solve a target problem collaboratively. Analytical results reveal that although the control group of learners with the IIM exhibited greater social interactions than the experimental group of learners with the proposed GIM, the experimental group exhibited better learning performance, group efficacy, and positive interactive relationships than the control group.",

The gathered information must be transmitted to the health care center without affecting the quality of data because its quality issue leads to create the packet drop, transmission throughput, maximum energy consumption, and delay. Hence, this paper develop the optimized routing protocol called bacterial bee swarm-based hybrid lifetime maximization large-scale mobile ad hoc routing protocol for performing data transmission process. The developed system examines the quality of data while improving the network lifetime in large area of mobile ad hoc network. The optimal path and data quality are continuously monitored and effective path and node are selected based on the bacterial bee swarm functions.

To cope with this problem, in this study, an interactive e-book system has been developed based on the contextual learning model to interpret the Analects of Confucius in an interactive way. A quasi-experiment was conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The participants were 38 fifth graders from 2 classes in an elementary school located in northern Taiwan, who were divided into an experimental and a control group. The experimental group used an interactive e-book learning mode to learn the Analects of Confucius course while the control group used a conventional technology enhanced teaching mode. The results showed that adopting the interactive e-book teaching mode to study the Analects of Confucius in the elementary school course can promote students' learning achievement and motive. It was also found that the interactive e-book learning mode can trigger learners' deep motive, and hence promote their learning achievement.",

In addition, although the literature contains studies examining online information searching behaviours based on experience, cognitive styles, and task complexity separately, there is only a limited number of studies that investigate how online information searching behaviours vary depending on individual characteristics by taking task complexity as a basis. The aim of this study is to explore whether university students' information searching behaviours, task completion times, and task completion rates in simple and difficult tasks differ depending on information searching experience and cognitive style. The study was conducted with a sample of 20 university students. The results of this study indicated that in difficult search tasks, online information searching experience is influential on the exhibition of online information searching behaviours associated with the metacognitive domain. In simple and difficult tasks, experience and cognitive styles cause differentiation in online information searching behaviours. When task complexity is taken as a basis, the experience is more influential on task completion time and task completion rate compared to cognitive styles.",

This is done by defining the Bayesian score as a measure of representativeness corresponding to the units of the population. The proposed procedure shows that RSS is a better sampling method and the probability of having the most unrepresentative sample is very less in case of RSS than in case of SRS, irrespective of whether the ranking is perfect or imperfect. The proposed procedure is also illustrated through a real-life data on survivorship of children below one year in Empowered Action Groups (EAG) states of India.",

First, we show that -statistic performs better than Kolmogorov- Smirnov (KS), mean square error (MSE) and maximum percentage error (MPE) based on extensive simulation study. Then, by using the T-statistic, we determine the distributions of ten real data sets shown to be consistent with the GP model by Lam et al. (2004). After validating the distribution for these data sets, we calculate the estimators of the parameters by using the suitable method given in Lam and Chan (1998), Chan, Lam, and Leung (2004) or Aydogdu, Senoglu, and Kara (2010).

Simulation studies show that the nonparametric RS-GWMA sign chart with large design and adjustment parameters outperforms competing charts considered in this article.

However, studies investigating online discussions in recent years have shown that off-topic messaging has increased with the use of social network services. Thus, determining the design of a mechanism to reduce the frequency of off-topic messaging is an issue deserving attention. This study develops a Facebook-based system and employs two strategies (a filter reminder strategy and a self-reflection strategy) aiming to reduce off-topic messaging in comparative and empirical studies. The research questions are as follows: (a) Which strategy is more effective in reducing off-topic messaging? (b) What are the influences of the strategies on the patterns of students' cognitive processes? and (c) Does this influence occur during discussions? The results indicate that the filter reminder strategy can not only reduce off-topic messaging but also elicit more diversified cognitive behaviors. Finally, based on the findings, this study provides suggestions for future research and advice regarding instruction.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "Precise prediction of risk for dyslexia among children\u2019s in earlier stages is a significant long-term aim in the field of cognitive computing. Producing such accurate results for detection of dyslexia from a dataset which consist of low-quality dataset and the presence of vague information is the toughest challenge among researchers. This paper aims at developing an evolving model to handle the impreciseness in the detection of dyslexia more intelligently. In this work, each instance is described in a neutrosophic domain by defining a membership degree of truthiness, indeterminacy, and falsity. These instances are neutrosophically clustered by applying Neutrosophic C-Means clustering (NCM) which forms four different clusters namely dyslexia, no dyslexia, control/revision and hyperactivity or other issues. The outlier and noise are the special categories of indeterminacy which often occurs in real datasets are promptly discovered and clustered. NCM is optimized by introducing Artificial Bacterial Foraging (ABF), especially when there is vagueness or imprecision in the selection of cluster centroids. With the merits of global searching, ABF selects more promising clustering during cluster re-computation. The interpreted results confirm that the role played by proposed ONCMC-ABF algorithm produces better results in the prediction of dyslexia with the low-quality dataset.",

Although several fundamental short-term forecasting models have been proposed, more accurate and efficient models are needed for IoE. Therefore, we propose a novel forecasting temporal negative binomial linear model (NBLM) that handles overdispersion and captures nonlinearity of electric load. We also classify the load into low, moderate, and high intraday seasons to increase the forecast accuracy by modeling the autocorrelation in each season, separately. The temporal NBLM was evaluated using real-world data from Jericho city, and its results were compared to other forecasting models. The temporal NBLM is found more accurate than the other models as the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is reduced by 29% compared to the ARMA model. In addition, the proposed model is more efficient as its running time is reduced by 63% in the training phase and by 87% in the forecast phase compared to the Holt-Winter model. This increase in accuracy and efficiency makes the proposed model applicable for load forecasting in IoE contexts where data volume is large and load is highly fluctuated, is overdispersed, is autocorrelated, and follows seasonal patterns.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "In the noncontractual setting of customer-base analysis, heterogeneity parameters in purchase model and lifetime model are usually assumed to follow some familiar parametric distribution such as gamma or log-normal distribution. But, in many applications, these assumptions may be questionable because the true distributions of heterogeneity parameters are usually unknown. To this end, this paper relaxes these assumptions imposed on heterogeneity parameters to develop a nonparametric approach to purchase model and lifetime model, in which unknown distributions of heterogeneity parameters are approximated by a truncated Dirichlet process prior. A nonparametric empirical Bayesian method is developed to obtain Bayesian estimations of unknown parameters in the proposed nonparametric models. The blocked Gibbs sampler is presented to draw observations required for Bayesian inference from the corresponding posterior distributions of the components of parameters. Extensive simulation studies and a CDNOW data set are presented to illustrate the newly developed methodologies.",

In recent years, researchers are trying to use the social characteristics of the network to propose new data forwarding metrics, so as to design more efficient routing algorithms. However, most of the proposed algorithms only consider local context information, which leads to the performance of the routing is not optimized enough. In this paper, we introduce two key metrics, namely, social relationship and social activity. The metrics will be used to search the best data forwarding nodes to improve the probability of data delivery. We propose a prediction-based social-aware opportunistic routing (PSOR). In the proposed method, node's social profiles are used to search relay candidates set, and the discrete-time semi-Markov prediction model is used to find the probability distribution of node transition between communities. Many simulation experiments based on real traces show that the proposed PSOR algorithm is more efficient to maximize the packet delivery probability than other state-of-the-art algorithms.",

In this paper, we have proposed a closed skew normal distribution for the genetic random effects which is more flexible and includes the normal distribution. The Bayesian inference approach and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms are developed for the parameter estimations.

In this regard, based on some different sorts of prior distributions for the unknown parameters, the appropriate designs are calculated. In the sequel, we define the random intercept model for the Cox regression model assuming the random intercept distributed normally. It is observed that the likelihood function of the observations cannot be acquired in a closed form. Thus, we obtain the quasi-information matrix based on the quasi-likelihood function. We then, use this matrix to obtain the A and D-optimal designs. It is seen that the Fisher information matrix depends on the unknown parameters as a result the locally optimal designs will be inefficient when the true guess about the parameters is failed. To overcome this problem, we propose the Bayesian strategy to obtain more robust optimal designs. Some numerical techniques such as Monte Carlo integration and numerical optimization methods are implemented to calculate the designs. Further, the generalized equivalence theorem is adapted to confirm the optimality of the proposed designs. All of the numerical results are done with R software. The results of this article will help to remove the weakness of the locally optimal designs that have been addressed in Schmidt and Schwabe when the parameters are misspecfied.",

There are several variations of pattern mining, such as frequent itemset mining, sequence mining, and high utility itemset mining. High utility itemset mining is an emerging data science task, aims to extract knowledge based on a domain objective. The utility of a pattern shows its effectiveness or benefit that can be calculated based on user priority and domain-specific understanding. The sequential pattern mining (SPM) issue is much examined and expanded in various directions. Sequential pattern mining enumerates sequential patterns in a sequence data collection. Researchers have paid more attention in recent years to frequent pattern mining over uncertain transaction dataset. In recent years, mining itemsets in big data have received extensive attention based on the Apache Hadoop and Spark framework. This paper seeks to give a broad overview of the distinct approaches to pattern mining in the Big Data domain. Initially, we investigate the problem involved with pattern mining approaches and associated techniques such as Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, parallel and distributed processing. Then we examine major developments in parallel, distributed, and scalable pattern mining, analyze them in the big data perspective and identify difficulties in designing the algorithms. In particular, we study four varieties of itemsets mining, i.e., parallel frequent itemsets mining, high utility itemset mining, sequential patterns mining and frequent itemset mining in uncertain data. This paper concludes with a discussion of open issues and opportunity. It also provides direction for further enhancement of existing approaches.",

The participants were 51 7th graders, and an eye-tracking system was used to record their visual behaviors and log data while they were using the simulation. As for data analysis, we first checked each participant's log data to examine whether they completed the requirement of the guidance, and then checked the correctness of her/his answer to the inquiry task. The participants were thus divided into two groups (correct vs. wrong), and the patterns of their visual behaviors were examined by a set of eye-movement indices, normalized heat maps and lag sequential analyses. The results indicate that both spatial distributions and temporal sequences of the participants' visual attention were associated with their performances on the inquiry task. Regarding the spatial distribution, the correct group tended to allocate more visual attention to the regions presenting the target phenomenon than the wrong group. Concerning the temporal sequence, the correct group tended to make more visual transitions among the content of the guidance, the relevant control panels and the target phenomena than the wrong group.",

However, enhancing precision, decreasing detection error, and detecting camouflaged items are still regarded as difficult problems. In this work, we concentrated on these problems and presented a model based on Faster-RCNN that utilizes saliency detection, proposal generation and bounding box regression, for better detection along with loss functions. The suggested method is referred to as the saliency driven Faster RCNN model for object detection and recognition using computer vision approach (SGFr-RCNN).

However, in traditional teaching, it is often difficult for learners to distinguish the meaning of different childbirth signs. While virtual reality (VR) may be connected in most people's minds with videos designed for immersive entertainment, in fact its early purpose was for nursing education. Initial forms of Spherical Video-based Virtual Reality (SVVR) were used to prepare and train nursing students, pilots, and military personnel. In this paper, an exploratory study using social learning theory embedded in SVVR for childbirth education training is presented; moreover, the learning performances of nursing students who participated in SVVR classroom learning and those who learned with the traditional approach were compared. The experimental results show that, compared with the traditional instruction, the learning motivation and learning satisfaction of the students who learned with SVVR were better, showing the potential of this powerful medium for enhancing nursing students' learning performance in the context of childbirth education.",

Second, we consider statistical inference of k-th correlation coefficient by using the empirical likelihood method, and the empirical likelihood statistic is shown to be asymptotically distributed as Chi-squared.

In this paper, two methods are discussed for deriving a bivariate discrete probability distribution from a continuous one by retaining some specific features of the original stochastic model, namely (1) the joint density function, or (2) the joint survival function. Examples of applications are presented, which involve two types of bivariate exponential distributions, in order to illustrate how the discretization procedures work and show whether and to which extent they alter the dependence structure of the original model. We also prove that some bivariate discrete distributions that were recently proposed in the literature can be actually regarded as discrete counterparts of well-known continuous models. A numerical study is presented in order to illustrate how the procedures are practically implemented and to present inferential aspects. Two real datasets, considering correlated discrete recurrence times (the former) and counts (the latter) are eventually fitted using two discrete analogues of a bivariate exponential distribution.",

We focus on the case in which a manufacturer deals with two suppliers that provide complementary products. We assume that the suppliers have the opportunity to improve their reliabilities through investments. The manufacturer determines her order quantities and the suppliers decide on their investment amounts in their capacities. The timing of the decisions has a substantial effect on the optimal behaviors of the players. We investigate the problem under four different settings based on the sequence of events: (1) simultaneous ordering and investment in which decisions are made concurrently, (2) ordering after observation of capacities in which the manufacturer orders after observing the suppliers\u2019 capacities, (3) ordering before realization of capacities in which the manufacturer orders after the suppliers\u2019 investment decisions, and (4) ordering before investments in which the suppliers invest after the manufacturer\u2019s ordering decision. We demonstrate the existence of a Pareto optimal equilibrium in the first two scenarios. In addition, we show that in the fourth scenario, there exists a unique Nash equilibrium in the suppliers\u2019 game. Based on the realized capacities of the suppliers, it may be beneficial for them to share their production information with the manufacturer. In addition, we indicate that using a sequential decision strategy can enhance the performances of the supply chain and the members. When the suppliers are the leaders, they implement investment inflation strategies to stimulate the manufacturer to place larger orders. When the manufacturer is the leader, she uses an order inflation strategy to increase the investment of the suppliers. Our numerical analysis revealed that in different situations, the players may prefer ordering before realization of capacities scenario or ordering before investments. Finally, we extended our results to a multiple-suppliers case in which the suppliers are identical.",

It has very large applications such as energy consumption analysis, forecasting hurricanes in meteorological data, fraud and intrusion detection, event detection and system monitoring in sensor networks, etc. Most of existing outlier detection techniques depend on the properties of a particular type of data and can not deal with a large volume of data well, which mean that there is a necessity for improved methodologies and techniques to be applied to a large amount of data with different types in other application areas. In this paper, a parallel outlier detection technique is developed to detect the outliers in the sequential data. Although there are many types of outliers, this paper concentrates on the contextual anomalies. The proposed technique uses a graph approach to detect the outliers. It is very flexible, fast, and no labeled data is needed comparing to many previous approaches. The experimental results show the detected contextual outliers in the sequential data, as well as the efficient scaling up to handle the massive data by increasing the number of processors. The results prove that the parallelism of the proposed technique is very valuable. (C) 2019 The Authors. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of clustering ensemble which aims to combine multiple clusterings into a probably better solution in terms of robustness, novelty and stability. The proposed Iterative Combining Clusterings Method (ICCM) processes iteratively the entire dataset, where each iteration is based on two steps framework. In the first step, different clustering algorithms process the common data set individually and, in the next step, a set of sub-clusters is extracted through a voting process among the data objects. To overcome the ambiguity due to voting, only objects with majority voting are assigned to their correspondent sub-clusters. The remaining objects are then collected and re-clustered in the next iterations. At the end of the iterative process, a clustering algorithm is used to group the obtained sub cluster centres and extract the final clusters of the dataset. Two gene expression datasets and three real-life datasets have been used to evaluate the proposed approach using external and internal criteria. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, where an improvement up to 16.89% for iris dataset, and up to 14.98% for wine dataset in DB index has been achieved. The external validity metrics confirm the usefulness of the proposed approach by achieving the highest average NMI (%) score of 81.05%, across the datasets compared to different clustering ensemble methods.

The non response is the source of missing data and it is an unavoidable phenomenon in survey sampling. This problem becomes more severe in the case of repeated surveys because of its repetitious nature. The missing data due to random causes which we call as random non-response is an important issue which needs to be dealt with a more cautious approach. To address these thoughts, this study is an attempt to reduce the adverse impact of random non response in the estimation of population variance on the current occasion in two-occasion successive sampling. A composite class of estimators for estimation of population variance on the current occasion has been proposed and its properties are deeply examined. An empirical study is carried out to show the efficacious performances of the proposed class of estimators over an estimator defined for the complete response situation.

It is important to explore how learner-learner, learner-teacher and learner-content interactions affect on learning outcomes while using the social sites such as Facebook, Twitter, WeChat, Blogs, etc. Although some prior research highlight that there is a demand for interaction in online courses, specific design tactics and empirical evaluation of the effects of interaction on learning outcomes in blog-based courses are lacking. Thus, a blog learning platform named \"Learner's Digest Blog\" (LDB) was developed to facilitate the three types of interactions and enhance learning outcomes. A total of 26 learners participated in the blog-based interactive learning environment. The study addressed two research questions, and regression analysis was used to analyze the data. The findings indicated a significant influence between learner-learner interaction, learner-teacher interaction and learner-content interaction on subjective learning outcome. In contrast, there was no significant influence of learner-teacher interaction on objective learning outcomes, but learner-learner and learner-content did significantly affect objective learning outcomes. A significant relationship was also found between students' subjective and objective learning outcomes.",

Our purpose of this paper is to articulate the application of variation theory in the form of a number of concrete design principles that offer prescriptive and practical guidelines for improving the designs of educational software programs. To achieve this, we analyzed a wide range of educational software programs produced over the years in our previous projects for learning Chinese characters. From this analysis, we identified four design principles, namely, (i) not aiming to test but to bring about learning, (ii) focusing on a specific object of learning, (iii) allowing learners to explore variation to be learned, and (iv) keeping all other aspects invariant. These design principles are specialized for designing how learners interact with educational software programs, which is the major practical contribution of this paper.",

Symbolic Artificial Intelligence with its hard coding rules is incapable of solving these complex problems resulting in the introduction of Deep Learning (DL) models such as Recurrent Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). However, CNNs require lots of training data and are incapable of recognizing pose and deformation of objects leading to the introduction of Capsule Networks. Capsule Networks are the new sensation in Deep Learning. They have lived to this expectation as their performance in relation to the above problems has been better than Convolutional Neural Networks. Even with this promise in performance, lack of architectural knowledge and inner workings of Capsules serves as a hindrance for researchers to take full advantage of this breakthrough. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the state of the art architectures, tools and methodologies in existing implementations of capsule networks. We highlight the successes, failures and opportunities for further research to serve as a motivation to researchers and industry players to exploit the full potential of this new field. The main contribution of this survey article is that it explains and summarizes significant current state of the art Capsule Network architectures and implementations. (c) 2019 The Authors.

Considering the fact that continuous data have more information rather than discrete data, survival time after cardiac surgery is considered as a continuous quality characteristic in this paper. Accelerated failure time regression model is used to adjust the risk of patients' conditions and surgeon groups on the survival times. After that, a risk-adjusted exponentially weighted moving average control chart is proposed to monitor the standardized residuals of accelerated failure time regression. Since the false alarm rate of each patient change dramatically, dynamic probability control limits have been extended to address the issue. The proposed method is evaluated in Phase II in terms of average run length criterion. The results indicate that the proposed method has acceptable performance in identifying the out-of-control state in the process. Furthermore, considering the effect of surgeon groups in the accelerated failure time regression model leads to improvement in the performance of the proposed method.",

First, the appropriate neighboring samples are found in the state of the sample point and the next state to form the neighborhood matrix. Then, the manifold hidden inside the data is extracted, ie, the evolution trend of the process parameters between different brands. At the same time, a monitoring model is built with the training data based on the support vector data description (SVDD). If an outlier is detected, it will be projected onto the manifold to obtain the adjustment values. Thus, the outlier can return to the normal state. The Swiss roll and actual production data of interstitial-free (IF) steels are employed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the new method considers the continuity of process parameters of different product grades in the production process and uses data to extract the potential manifold, ie, using the evolution trend of process parameters among different product grades to achieve the optimization of the process parameter. The proposed method provides a new process parameter optimization method for the actual production process.",

If the response is binary there is a mixture of Bernoulli distributions, which has practical applications for the classification of texts and images, biochemistry, genetics, robotics, computer science or pattern recognition. A finite mixture of probability distributions includes a set of parameters such as the proportion of the mixture and the parameters of each distribution. This simple case allows us to make some explicit computations of the estimators as well as working on the EM algorithm doing some comparisons. Some of these parameters may depend on one or more covariates through some specific model. Mixtures of exponential family distributions, except in very particular cases, are no longer within the exponential family and this means, among other things, that the expectation for computing the Information Matrix must, in most cases, be approximated. One of the main contributions of this article is its handling of this. Linear and logistic models are considered either for the proportion of one of the two populations (clusters), or for the parameters of the Bernoulli distributions. For each of these cases the analytic expression of the information matrix is calculated and optimal designs determined.",

By using recent results obtained in the problem of temporal dependence structure of univariate stochastic processes, where the auto-codifference was used, we extend its idea and propose a cross-codifference measure for a general bidimensional vector autoregressive time series of order 1 (bidimensional VAR(1)). Next, we derive analytical results for VAR(1) model with Gaussian and stable sub-Gaussian innovations, that are characterized by finite and infinite variance, respectively. We emphasize that obtained expressions perfectly agree with the empirical counterparts. Moreover, we show that for the considered time series the cross-codifference simplifies to the well-established cross-covariance in the case when the innovations of time series are given by Gaussian white noise. The last part of the work is devoted to the statistical estimation of VAR(1) time series parameters based on the empirical cross-codifference. Again, we demonstrate via Monte Carlo simulations that the proposed methodology works correctly.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "In the field of shape analysis, landmarks are defined as a low-dimensional, representative set of important features of an object's shape that can be used to identify regions of interest along its outline. An important problem is to infer the number and arrangement of landmarks, given a set of shapes drawn from a population. One proposed approach defines a posterior distribution over landmark locations by associating each landmark configuration with a linear reconstruction of the shape. In practice, sampling from the resulting posterior density is challenging using standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods because multiple configurations of landmarks can describe a complex shape similarly well, manifesting in a multi-modal posterior with well-separated modes. Standard MCMC methods traverse multi-modal posteriors poorly and, even when multiple modes are identified, the relative amount of time spent in each one can be misleading. We apply new advances in the parallel tempering literature to the problem of landmark detection, providing guidance on implementation generalized to other applications within shape analysis. Proposal adaptation is used during burn-in to ensure efficient traversal of the parameter space while maintaining computational efficiency. We demonstrate this algorithm on simulated data and common shapes obtained from computer vision scenes.",

In a previous paper, we have shown that the conditional selection criteria perform worse than their marginal counterparts. It is known that for some ?vague? priors, their impact on the estimated model parameters can be non-negligible, e.g., for the priors of the covariance matrix of the random effects in a longitudinal LMM. We evaluate here the impact of vague priors for the covariance matrix of the random effects on selecting the correct LMM using classical Bayesian selection criteria. We consider marginal and conditional criteria. For the random intercept case, we assign different vague priors to the variance parameters. With two or more random effects, we considered five different specifications of inverse-Wishart (IW) prior, five different separation priors and a joint prior. The results show again the better performance of the marginal over the conditional criteria and the superiority of joint and separation priors over IW in all settings. We also illustrate the performance of the selection criteria on a practical dataset.",

Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is an open publish/subscribe-based messaging protocol that is widely used for device communication in IoT. For data transmission between devices, different levels of quality of service (QoS) are used in MQTT. In this paper, we provide a formal model for MQTT protocol under the Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP) semantic framework, where QoS levels in MQTT are modeled as designs in UTP. Refinement and equivalence relations between QoS levels can be established naturally via implication between predicates. Moreover, Prototype Verification System (PVS) is used to encode the UTP design models and some important properties as well as the refinement relation between QoS levels is proved with the PVS proof assistant.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "Nowadays, individuals express experiences and opinions through online reviews. These has an influence on online marketing and obtaining real knowledge about products and services. However, some of the online reviews can be unreal. They may have been written to promote low-quality products/services or sabotage a product/service reputation to mislead potential customers. Such misleading reviews are known as spam reviews and require crucial attention. Prior spam detection research focused on English reviews, with less attention to other languages. The detection of spam reviews in Arabic online sources is a relatively new topic despite the relatively huge amount of data generated. Therefore, this paper contributes to such topic by presenting four different Arabic spam reviews detection methods, while putting more focus towards the construction and evaluation of an ensemble approach. The proposed ensemble method is based on integrating a rule-based classifier with machine learning techniques, while utilizing content-based features that depend on N-gram features and Negation handling. The four proposed methods are evaluated on two datasets of different sizes. The results indicate the efficiency of the ensemble approach where it achieves a classification accuracy of 95.25% and 99.98% for the two experimented datasets and outperforming existing related work by far of 25%.

In surveillance applications, when sensors are deployed randomly along a path in order to monitor boundaries of battlefields or country borders, gaps are usually unavoidable. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient distributed algorithm for weak-barrier coverage using event-based clustering and adaptive sensor rotation. We consider a wireless sensor network consisting of randomly deployed sensor nodes and directional border nodes deployed using a random line deployment model. When an event is detected, sensor nodes form one or more event-based clusters. Cluster heads are in charge with aggregating data from the clusters and sending them to the border nodes, which will adjust the orientation angle such that to monitor intruders crossing the barrier. We use simulations using WSNet and MatLab to analyze the performance of our algorithm and to compare it with other non-clustering gap-mending algorithms.",

In order to ensure good coverage, to minimize the cost of installation and to put more emphasis in the areas having a high number of accidents.

A detailed analysis of algorithm examples shows that the heuristic algorithm can greatly reduce the number of processing nodes compared to the backtracking algorithm without information; meanwhile, the algorithm's time complexity is related to the number of loops in the directed graph. If a directed graph G(V, E) only contains loops that contain the starting point, then the Hamiltonian problem of G can be determined in polynomial time. The algorithm is implemented using C++ and Python programming, and all of the test graphs are generated by the random graph algorithm. The experiments show that the heuristic algorithm can reduce the number of extended nodes by at least 10% in directed random graphs with no or only a few loops. This heuristic algorithm can save time in applications that perform tasks while extending nodes because it reduce the number of extended nodes.",

The chart performance is assessed using optimized design parameters that provide the smallest ARL for a range of shifts. A performance comparison of the ZIP-AEWMA chart is conducted with the competing charts in terms of the relative mean index (RMI) metric. Results show that the ZIP-AEWMA chart has superior performance over the competing charts for a wide range of process shifts, especially when the probability of excessive zeros in data is high.

It is important to measure the system reliability of a stochastic flow network from the perspective of operations management. In the real world, the system reliability of a stochastic flow network can vary over time. Hence, a critical issue emerges\u2014characterizing the time attribute in a stochastic flow network. To solve this issue, this study bridges (classical) reliability theory and the reliability of a stochastic flow network. This study utilizes Weibull distribution as a possible reliability function to quantify the time attribute in a stochastic flow network. For more general cases, the proposed model and algorithm can apply any reliability function and is not limited to Weibull distribution. First, the reliability of every single component is modeled by Weibull distribution to consider the time attribute, where such components comprise a multi-state element. Once the time constraint is given, the capacity probability distribution of elements can be derived. Second, an algorithm to generate minimal component vectors for given demand is provided. Finally, the system reliability can be calculated in terms of the derived capacity probability distribution and the generated minimal component vectors. In addition, a big data architecture is proposed for the model to collect and estimate the parameters of the reliability function. For future research in which very large volumes of data may be collected, the proposed model and architecture can be applied to time-dependent monitoring.",

It is known that these estimations are usually biased in small samples but asymptotically unbiased. On the other hand, initial parameter values are sensitive for parameter estimation in NR for MLE. Our aim of the study is to present an approach on parameter estimation bias using inverse conditional distributions based on distribution assumption giving true parameter values and to compare this approach on different penalized LR methods. With this aim, LR, Firth LR, FLIC and FLAC methods were compared in terms of parameter estimation bias, predicted probability bias and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for different sample sizes, event and correlation rates conducting a detailed Monte Carlo simulation study.

    "original_csv_abstract": "The number of the massive open online courses (MOOCs) around the globe is on the rise. Despite the popularity of MOOCs, they have received less attention from faculty members around the globe compared to other less-traditional and digital education models. MOOCs can be challenging for teachers to use. As such, understanding how to facilitate teachers? adoption of MOOCs is very important to better promote their use. The aim of this research paper is to investigate the drivers of teachers? acceptance and use of MOOCs from the perspective of the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2). An online survey was used to collect responses from university faculty in Taiwan. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was utilized for data analysis. The findings reveal that performance expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and price value facilitated teachers? behavioral intention to adopt MOOCs. Furthermore, facilitating conditions and behavioral intention determined teachers? adoption of MOOCs. However, effort expectancy and hedonic motivation failed to drive teachers? adoption of MOOCs. Based on the findings, several important theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

A common tool in analyzing this cop number of a graph is a cop moving along a shortest path in a graph, thus preventing the robber to step onto this path. We generalize this approach by introducing a shadow of the robber, the maximal set of vertices from which the cop parries the protected subgraph. In this context, the robber becomes an intruder and the cop becomes the guard. We show that the shadow can be computed in polynomial time, implying polynomial time algorithms for computing both a successful guard as well as a successful intruder, whichever exists. Furthermore, we show that shadow function generalizes the concept of graph retractions. In some cases, this implies a polynomially computable certification of the negative answer to the NP-complete problem of existence of a retraction to a given subgraph.",

Here, We have not only proposed a framework for big data sentiment analysis on real-time updates in online reviews or text for optimal or best decision selection (for example selection of a restaurant) from existing huge list of N number of restaurants but also implemented our proposed framework as a mathematical algorithm (named as Algorithm 4.1) by using soft computing technique for finding reduct soft set of consolidated review matrix. We further quantified sentiments in three values (1, \u22121, and 0), either in 1 for (positive/yes/true) or \u22121 for (negative/no/False) and 0 for (neutral or absence of sentiment) and stored them in a table (named as ternary sentiment table). Then, we have done an entropic calculation on this ternary sentiment table to find the quantity of information stored in its associated rows and columns. This proposed quantification further helps to identify the most important attribute of the table. It helps to decide weight for the different attributes and applying calculated weights to corresponding attributes to obtain the quantified ordered decision-making values.",

The vehicular nodes in NLOS conditions possess the possibility of introducing channel congestion and broadcast storm into the network either intentionally or unintentionally during the event of emergency message dissemination in the vehicular network. Thus, the NLOS vehicular nodes of the network need to be detected through direct interaction and neighbourhood collaboration such that the rate of emergency message dissemination is sustained to the maximum degree. In this paper, a Rank Criteria Improved Confidence-based Centroid Scheme (RCICCS) is proposed for potential localization of NLOS nodes. This proposed RCICCS scheme uses an integrated cost, computed using the primitive cost and penalty cost in order to increase the effectiveness in localizing NLOS nodes. Thus effective location of NLOS nodes is determined based on rank criterion-based neighbor confidence measure that are iteratively enhanced during the process of perturbation using the method of gradients. The experimental analysis of the proposed RCICCS scheme confirmed a remarkable enhancement rate of emergency message delivery and neighbourhood awareness under NLOS conditions.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "Correlation can seriously degrade reliability and capacity due to the simultaneous failure of multiple components, which lowers the probability that a system can execute its required functions with acceptable levels of confidence. The high cost of fault in time-critical systems necessitates methods to explicitly consider the influence of correlation on reliability. This paper constructs a network-structured model, namely time-constrained multi-state network (TCMSN), to investigate the capacity of a computer network. In the TCMSN, the physical lines comprising the edges of the computer network experience correlated faults. Our approach quantifies the probability that d units of data can be sent from source to sink in no more than T units of time. This probability that the computer network delivers a specified level of data before the deadline is referred to as the system reliability. Experimental results indicate that the negative influence of correlation on reliability could be significant, especially when the data amount is close to network bandwidth and the time constraint is tight. The modeling approach will subsequently promote design and optimization studies to mitigate the vulnerability of networks to correlated faults.",

Hence in this paper, we focus on some inferential results of the skew-normal distribution. The amount of Fisher information in the order statistics of a simple random sample is studied and some properties are discussed with respect to variations of skewness parameter. Also, the most informative part of a sample is determined via simulation. The maximum likelihood estimators of skewness parameter are derived based on both complete sample and the most informative part of the sample and their efficiencies are compared. Furthermore, a ranked based sampling scheme is introduced to do inference about the skewness parameter in populations with high right skewness.

It capitalizes the aforesaid principles to produce outcomes like MD2, MD5, SHA-160, SHA-224/256, SHA-256, SHA-224/512, SHA-256/512, SHA-384/512, SHA-512, and SHA-3. These functions use bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and MOD operators to foresee randomness in their hash outputs. However, the partial breaking of SHA2 and SHA3 families and the breaking of MD5 and SHA-160 algorithms raise concerns on the use of bitwise operators at the block level. The proposed design tries to address this structural flaw through a polynomial function. A polynomial function of degree 128 demands arduous effort to be decoded in the opposing direction. The application of a polynomial on the blocks produces an unpredictable random response. It is a fact that the new design exhibits the merits of the polynomial function on subsets to achieve the avalanche response to a significant level. The output from experiments with more than 24 Million hash searches proves the proposed system is a provably secure hash function. The experiments on avalanche response and confusion and diffusion analysis prove it is an apt choice for security-centric cryptographic applications.",

Timely identification of students at risk has high practical value in effective students' retention services. Big Data mining and machine learning methods are applied to manipulate, analyze and predict students' failure, supporting self-directed learning. Despite the extensive application of data mining to education, the imbalance problem in minority classes of students' attrition is often overlooked in conventional models. This document proposes a large data frame using the Hadoop ecosystem and the application of machine learning techniques to different datasets of an academic year at the Hellenic Open University. Datasets were divided into thirty-five weeks. Thirty-two classifiers were created, compared and statistical analyzed to address the minority classes' imbalance of student's failure. The algorithms metacost-SMO, and C4.5 provide the most accurate performance for each target class. Early predictions of timeframes determine a remarkable performance, while the importance of written assignments and specific quizzes is noticeable. The models' performance in any week is exploited by developing a prediction tool for student attrition, contributing to timely and personalized intervention.",

Top-of-rack Ethernet switches dominate network cost and energy consumptions in DCs. Optical switching technologies have been introduced into DC networks to increase switching capacity and to reduce energy consumption. However, how to design high-performance optical intrarack networks is still a great challenge. This paper presents a software-defined passive optical intrarack network (SD-POIRN) based on optical coupler fabrics. The data plane of SD-POIRN is a broadcast-and-select optical network combining wavelength division multiplexing and time division multiplexing technologies. The control plane of SD-POIRN has a centralized rack controller for scheduling intrarack data transmissions. This paper proposes a software-defined media access control (SD-MAC) protocol for SD-POIRN. The SD-MAC utilizes dynamic transmission and receiving server grouping methods and max-min fair share bandwidth allocation algorithms to dynamically allocate bandwidth among servers in an efficient and fair manner. Network performance evaluation results show that, when the offered load is high, the proposed SD-MAC protocol effectively increases network throughput and reduces average packet delay compared with previous works.",

In this design, the interval between two successive sampling intervals, the sample size and the number of adjustment points alongside, the parameters of the monitoring scheme are determined such that not only the implementation cost is minimized, but also the profile exhibits desired statistical performances. To this aim, three objective functions are considered in the multi-objective optimization model of the problem. The Lorenzen-Vance cost function is used to model the implementation cost as the first objective function to be minimized. The second objective function maximizes the in-control average run length of the monitoring scheme (ARL(0)), while the third objective function minimizes the out-of-control average run length (ARL(1)). In addition, a lower bound is defined in a constraint for ARL(0) and an upper bound is determined in another constraint for ARL(1). The complex multi-objective optimization problem is solved by an NSGA-II algorithm, whose parameters are tuned using response surface methodology (RSM). A numerical illustration is solved, for which the Pareto optimal solutions are ranked by a multi-criteria decision-making method called Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Finally, sensitivity analyses are conducted on the parameters of the cost function, based on which the time required to sample and create a profile is the most important factor.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "Given a process model and an event log, conformance checking aims to relate the two together, e.g. to detect discrepancies between them. For the synchronous product net of the process and a log trace, we can assign different costs to a synchronous move, and a move in the log or model. By computing a path through this (synchronous) product net, whilst minimizing the total cost, we create a so-called optimal alignment \u2014 which is considered to be the primary target result for conformance checking. Traditional alignment-based approaches (1) have performance problems for larger logs and models, and (2) do not provide reliable diagnostics for non-conforming behaviour (e.g. bottleneck analysis is based on events that did not happen). This is the reason to explore an alternative approach that maximizes the use of observed events. We also introduce the notion of milestone activities, i.e. unskippable activities, and show how the different approaches relate to each other. We propose a data structure, that can be computed from the process model, which can be used for (1) computing alignments of many log traces that maximize synchronous moves, and (2) as a means for analysing non-conforming behaviour. In our experiments we show the differences of various alignment cost functions. We also show how the performance of constructing alignments with our data structure relates to that of the state-of-the-art techniques.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "Predicting the educational performance of students turns into more complex aspect due to the vast data volume in the database. The conventional systems have failed to analyze and monitor the progress of the student; often the promising performance is not being addressed. It is due to inappropriate method selection and investigation lagging. This paper intends to predict the educational performance of students based on socio-demographic information. It introduces a performance prediction architecture that includes two modules. One module is to handle the big data via MapReduce framework (incorporates the concept of principle component analysis), whereas the second module is an intelligent module that predicts the performance of the students using data processing stages. For this, this paper introduces a new hybrid classifier, which hybridizes the deep belief network and support vector machine. The output from the proposed classifier gives an accurate prediction of student performance. The performance of the proposed prediction model is compared over other conventional methods in terms of accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, negative predictive value, F1-score Matthews correlation coefficient, false positive rate, false negative rate and false discovery rate, and proven the superiority of proposed prediction model.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "With the advent of increasingly diverse services, applications, and use cases, the 5G mobility environment is expected to be highly heterogeneous. The distributed mobility management (DMM) is emerging as a promising approach for 5G, which provides decentralized handover and traffic management at the edge of the network. However, in order to meet the disparate mobility needs, the DMM process requires flexible design considerations. This paper presents a novel mobile node (MN) centered, software-defined networking (SDN)-based flexible mobility management architecture, named adaptive multimode mobility management (A3M), which can adaptively operate in multiple modes. The proposed A3M architecture incorporates a novel handover mode selection phase among the traditional handover phases during which a suitable mode of handover operation is evaluated. This makes the A3M handover process adaptable to the varying mobility requirements of the MN and enables it to provide differentiated handover management for MNs with different mobility profiles. The performance analysis of A3M shows that it offers optimal handover performance in terms of primary handover performance metrics such as session disruption delay, packet losses, and signaling costs, compared to the popular network-based DMM approaches.",

Furthermore, this helps to attain better concept comprehension pertaining to improved understanding of the topics. The present study provides evidence by developing an AR learning environment (ARLE) suitable for complicated theoretical topics of electronics engineering, which otherwise cannot be demonstrated using practical experiments. The idea of using different design variants; such as mobile and table-top for adaptive AR is also implemented. For this, 60 undergraduate students of electronics and electrical engineering were introduced to the ARLE system, in two different case studies. The first case validates the efficacy of using AR for learning the concept of stability in linear control systems through a questionnaire based survey where students reported the ARLE as an effective learning system for theoretical topics. Second case study provides comparative analysis for usability of two design variants of the ARLE in terms of manipulability and comprehensibility. Finally, the design implications for developed ARLE are discussed, which may be helpful for other researchers in creating learning environments for different courses of engineering education.",

Jamming may be made by either external jammer node or internal node, which may become as an adversary in future. In this paper, two approaches are proposed in the cluster-based sensor network to detect the maliciousness level of nodes to secure sensor networks from jamming attacks. First approach detects maliciousness level of nodes using two modules, namely, certification module and monitoring module. Certification module defends the network from the jammers. Monitoring module discovers the sensor nodes that are jammed by a jammer. Second approach uses fuzzy logic for optimizing the jamming metrics to determine the occurrence of jamming accurately. The proposed system achieves 99.58% detection ratio to determine node's maliciousness level.",

However, there is significant difference in reliability prediction based on different process. This paper proposes a unified distribution model combined with a stochastic process model in multiple accelerated stress degradation test. To solve the problem of heterogeneous population of pseudo failure data, the Birnbaum\u2013Saunders model is considered as a unified distribution model for different Gaussian family process. To give an example, a detailed proof for substituting the Birnbaum\u2013Saunders model for the first-passage time of Wiener process is provided. Then, the influence of the parameters of the Birnbaum\u2013Saunders model was analyzed, which provided a basis for the Birnbaum\u2013Saunders model to be selected as a unified model. To verify presented model, a case study of Smart Meter ADT is conducted. And the obtained results of this work is compared with former work of Smart Meter ADT modeling, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed modeling method to heterogeneous population.",

As technology advances at a rapid pace, some issues yet remain unresolved. One of the issues is phishing, which dates back to the 1980s. Phishing is an art used by cybercriminals from the 1980s until to date targeting online users to harvest financial, confidential, and other sensitive information. The art and the methodologies used by cybercriminals have not evolved much from the AOL (American online) heydays. However, the counter mechanisms to defeat phishing have undergone considerable changes over the past two decades. Although sophisticated antiphishing systems are in place, statistics shows that phishing is a major threat. Our practical research proves that one of the state-of-the-art antiphishing systems can be bypassed using simple techniques. The research further demonstrates why today's antiphishing mechanisms fail and the need for a novel mechanism that will identify the authenticity of the website. In this manuscript, an antiphishing algorithm, PhishSec (PH-Sec), is introduced. PhishSec will not consider the URL of the website as the primary factor to determine the authenticity, rather take a reverse approach where the URL of the website is derived by analyzing the content of the visited website to establish its authenticity. To accomplish this, the HTML DOM (document object model) of a given web page on load is considered. This manuscript quotes the research results of the analysis of a state-of-the-art antiphishing system along with the introduced algorithm to counter-attack phishing. The introduced system detects phishing attacks with 99.21% of accuracy.",

However, it will cause out-of-order delivery of packets, which will not only severely debilitate the performances of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) but also will make many single-path-based applications work improperly. In this paper, we propose to utilize passive delay measurements between end-hosts, to detect multipath routing with two different hypothesis testing approaches, ie, t-Test and variance test. The motivation is that the obtained distributions of passive delays between end-to-end communication flows can be very similar to each other when they are routed by the identical end-to-end path, whereas distinct differences are observed among the ones of different end-to-end paths. Simulations based on NS2 validate the efficiency of both t-Test and variance test and demonstrate the robustness of t-Test against asynchronous measurements between different flows.",

In some studies, the random units selected for the treatment and control group are out of control of the researcher and there may be differences between the units under consideration. This will cause the estimates obtained to be biased. Propensity score matching (PSM) has been used to reduce bias in estimation of treatment effect in observational data. Therefore, nearest neighbor (1:1), caliper, stratification, mahalanobis metric, full and combining propensity score and mahalanobis metric matching, which have been widely used as PSM methods, were compared in terms of the correct classification rates conducting a detailed Monte Carlo simulation study. In addition, standardized and percent reduction bias of covariates were evaluated for each of the PSM methods. It is suggested that stratification and full matching methods should be considered to study with high correct classification rate whereas caliper matching method should be prefered due to the low bias to make statistical inferences.",

Based on Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the increase in efficiency of the SPCD by use of the PGDRM and SCD can be significant, especially when the variation of responses between patients is large.

Congested network causes reduced network response time, queuing delay, and more packet loss. To address the issue of congestion, we have proposed transmission rate control methods. To avoid the congestion, we have adjusted the transmission rate at current node based on its traffic loading information. Multiclassification is done to control the congestion using an effective data science technique, namely support vector machine (SVM). In order to get less miss classification error, differential evolution (DE) and grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithms are used to tune the SVM parameters. The comparative analysis has shown that the proposed approaches DE-SVM and GWO-SVM are more proficient than other classification techniques. Moreover, DE-SVM and GWO-SVM have outperformed the benchmark technique genetic algorithm-SVM by producing 3% and 1% less classification errors, respectively. For fault detection in wireless sensor networks, we have induced four types of faults in the sensor readings and detected the faults using the proposed enhanced random forest. We have made a comparative analysis with state of the art data science techniques based on two metrics, ie, detection accuracy and true positive rate. Enhanced random forest has detected the faults with 81% percent accuracy and outperformed the other classifiers in fault detection.",

The study analyzes how the trajectory movement of students in various academic places of their interest influences sustainable academic performance. A person-administered survey approach was conducted initially followed by a focus group interview. The results of this research revealed that there are innumerable differences among university learners in terms of trajectory movement, and most of the students care only about a few common learning places like classrooms or laboratories. However, there are other trajectory movements that directly or indirectly influence sustainable academic performance. The research findings suggest that students and academicians are aware of not only the frequent trajectory movements, such as in the classroom, laboratory, and library but also the other trajectory movements inside and outside the campus which may severely affect sustainable academic performance. This study focuses on discovering the relationship between university students' trajectory movement tendencies and sustainable performance in higher educational institutions to fulfill sustainable development goals and how trajectory movements affect students' educational performance in various ways to ensure a better academic outcome for sustainable development.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "The risk of sharing data in cloud computing has gathered increasing attention. After the owner of some confidential data outsources the data to cloud storage services and shares it with others, the data owner lost the control to the data to a large extent. To achieve data sharing while keeping data confidentiality, attribute-based encryption (ABE) can be employed by cloud storage services. However, ABE can only guarantee that outsourced data on the cloud is decrypted by attribute-satisfying users but cannot restrict data from being accessed by dishonest users whose attributes also satisfy the access-control policy. It is impossible for the data owner to control the shared data after it has been decrypted by dishonest users, especially when a set of attribute-satisfying dishonest users may collude. To address this concern, we propose a traceable data sharing scheme called TraceChain. In TraceChain, data is encrypted over a new CP-ABE scheme called E-CP-ABE. Furthermore, the system parameters for generating the private key in E-CP-ABE are uploaded to the private blockchain and transactions are performed on the chain. The data owner can obtain the identity of users by monitoring system parameters simultaneously and control data sharing on the blockchain. To prove the security of our scheme, the security analysis is given in this paper. Meanwhile, experimental results also show that our system is viable and efficient.",

In a word, the problem that always exists in transformer fault diagnosis technology is the problem of discretization of fault data. In order to solve this problem, this paper creatively proposes a health condition diagnosis method of distribution transformer based on large data. This method innovatively proposes that the dissolved gas analysis value of distribution transformer is the conditional attribute, and the fault type is the decision attribute, and the fault decision table is established. The continuous attribute data in the decision table are discretized by using the optimization behavior of large data sets. Subsequently, the discretized decision table is simplified by using the big data theory, and the decision table of fault diagnosis rules is established, which greatly simplifies the difficulty of attribute simplification of decision table and makes diagnosis more convenient. Finally, an example shows that the proposed method can effectively discretize and reduce samples. Compared with traditional methods, it improves the accuracy of fault diagnosis.",

First, the proposed system receives an original Android application package (APK) file along with possible candidate cloned APKs over the cloud network. The system uses an apkExtractor tool to extract Dalvik Executable (DEX) files for each subject program. The Jdex decompiler is used to extract Java source files from DEXs. Then, the bag-of-word model is used to extract tokenized features from source files. Further, the weighting filters are used to zoom the importance of each token. Moreover, Synthetic Minority Oversampling is applied to retrieve balanced features for better training of data. Finally, TensorFlow with Keras deep learning model is designed to predict clones in Android applications. The experimental results have shown that Droid-IoT can successfully detect cloned apps with an accuracy of up to 96%.

We show how to make this top down approach computationally tractable by using the class of affine point processes, which are intensity-based jump processes driven by affine jump diffusions. An affine point process is sufficiently flexible to account for both country global infrastructure and driving behaviour. Further it allows for efficient computation and calibration of a large class of insurance products.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "In Medical Image Processing (MIP), the images are influenced by various types of noises. Hence, reducing such noises becomes a crucial issue. The main objective is to denoise the noisy images effectively with reduced computational cost. This paper proposes a denoising technique using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Social Spider Optimization (SSO) algorithm. Initially, DWT is applied over various noises over the input medical images. Then, the wavelet coefficients are optimized by applying the SSO algorithm. Finally, the inverse of DWT (IDWT) is applied over the optimized coefficients. The denoised image is obtained, and then, the PSNR evaluation is utilized for finding the superior performance. Experimental results using MATLAB show that the proposed algorithm has better performance when compared with the existing approaches.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "In today's modern era, the internet usage has been developing tremendously. In data center network (DCN), the traffic has been rising constantly in the past few years. Hence, greater traffic of network needs several services such as Domain Name Service (DNS) to manage. It is not possible for one server to manage entire requests coming from client because of huge amount of traffic. To resolve this issue, load balancing is used. The major purpose of load balancing is to forward incoming client requests and distribute the traffic across various servers using customized algorithm which is deployed in the load balancer. Traditional load balancers are very costly and inflexible hardware. A substitute of this hardware is to use software-defined network load balancers. The software-defined networking (SDN) load balancers offer the facility to programmers to design and construct their own strategy of load balancing, which makes the software-defined network load balancer flexible and programmable. This research proposes a novel algorithm that performs load balancing through calculating in advance the capacity of each and every switch across the path to which the packets are routed.",

    "original_csv_title": "Grey wolf assisted SIFT for improving copy move image forgery detection",
    "original_csv_abstract": "Copy-move forgery is a general widespread type of digital image forgery, where a segment of an image is attached into a new portion of the similar image to hide or replicate the parts which are called forgered image. The forgered image appears original, as the objective region in spite of being forged, has attained the fundamental qualities of the similar image itself. The capability of the copy-move forgery detection (CMFD) technique is lacked due to some post-processing functions, like JPEG compression scaling, or rotation, etc. Therefore, this paper intends to develop a CMFD using Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), best-fin-first algorithm (BBF) and RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) directed by grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm. Initially, the keypoints are selected using SIFT principle, and BBF algorithm identifies the matched keypoints using keypoint threshold. Further, SIFT feature descriptor is determined, and the final extracted paired keypoints are given to RANSAC algorithm to remove all the mismatched keypoints. In this CMFD model, the parameters such as parameters keypoint threshold, maximum distance of inliers in RANSAC and distance threshold in SIFT features are optimized using GWO. The foremost purpose of this research work is maximizing the number of paired keypoints. Hence the proposed model is termed as GWO-based parameter optimization for CMFD (GWPO-CMD). The proposed model is compared over several other meta-heuristic-based keypoint threshold selections and proves its efficiency through diverse analysis.",

The placement of relay nodes in a wireless body area network (WBAN) plays an important role in design of energy efficient and reliable WBAN. This problem is a joint problem of data routing and placement of relay nodes and formulated as a linear integer programming model. The main objective of the problem is to minimize the cost of relay nodes, energy consumption and distributing the loads uniformly on the relay nodes. Considering the hardness of the problem, we propose an adaptive cuckoo search based algorithm which uses an efficient fitness function and an adaptive step size proportional to the fitness function for placement of relay nodes. The set of relay nodes obtained by our proposed adaptive cuckoo search algorithm compared with cuckoo search as well as other state of the art algorithms via simulation results. The simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm not only consumes less energy than its counterparts but also distributes the load evenly on the relay nodes. We consider two different postures of the body with 13 biosensors placed in fixed positions and 50\u2013100 candidate sites for placement of relay nodes. Furthermore, we also consider 80 biosensors randomly deployed in a rectangular area with 50\u2013300 candidate sites to study the scalability of our algorithm.",

The proposed app covers five main categories with an interactive quiz, included in each, as an assessment tool. The lessons included in each category are viewed as a series of colorful pictures with a written sentence and an audio message to describe the meaning of each, thereby attracting the child's attention and making learning a fun activity. Each child's supervisor can access his/her quizzes' records, measure the child's progress in different categories, and use the related recommendation reports to adjust the app usage pattern. AIA was tested by a group of autistic children for a one-month test period in a real life environment represented in \"Jordan Specialized Center for Autism\" and the results and feedback were very promising.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "This paper measures the worst-case efficiency of price-only contracts in closed-loop supply chains (CLSCs) with the price of anarchy (PoA). We model a single-period Stackelberg game in which a manufacturer sells new products to a retailer and collects used products with exogenous retail price and collection price via three alternative reverse channels: (a) the manufacturer collects directly from customers, (b) the retailer collects for the manufacturer, and (c) a third party is awarded a collection subcontract from the manufacturer. We carry out a comprehensive investigation under push-pull configurations to observe how reverse channel structures with different gaming sequences of CLSC members influence the worst-case performance when the demand distribution is over the set of increasing generalized failure rate distributions. From our PoA analysis, we find that the pull system does not always outperform the push system, especially when the retailer is the leader, in contrast to the results for forward supply chains. While the PoA of the push system is dramatically sensitive to the quality condition of used products, the pull system has a constant efficiency loss that is independent of the quality condition.

    "original_csv_abstract": "The importance of inventory management for perishable items has been steadily attracting attention. Because of the characteristics of items whose values drop precipitously or cannot be sold after a particular time, items should be disposed of by a markdown sale. Accordingly, the company makes the following decisions at the end of the selling season: (a) selection on which products to be discounted, (b) pricing of the product, and (c) timing of the sale. Extant literature on the inventory problem has mainly focused on investigating decisions on selecting products for discount and the amount of the discount. That is, the decision on the start time of the markdown sale was not extensively studied. This study focuses on the optimal combination of a start time of the markdown sale and an order quantity based on a newsvendor model. Under certain conditions in a decentralized system, the start time of a markdown sale, where the retailer obtains the highest profit, is the least profitable for the manufacturer. Therefore, we propose a revenue-sharing contract to avoid irrational ordering behavior by a retailer against a manufacturer. Centralization through the revenue-sharing contract improves the profits of the retailer and manufacturer compared to those earned in the decentralized system.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "The growth of social networks is ever-increasing. Many available scientific publications evidence the interest of researchers in this area. Within a time span of eight years from 2011 to 2018, approximately 2600, 230, 150, and 110 scientific articles were published from the USA, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, respectively around this area of research. To comprehensively survey all the sub-fields and interests within this research area, the present paper proposes a novel density-based method for finding topic descriptors from academic articles. By employing a robust to noise fuzzy clustering algorithm, the terms are clustered, and by utilizing a modified Parzen window, k topic descriptors from each cluster are extracted. Besides, an optimization problem has been designed to detect the similarity between word pairs. By conducting the experiments, the research priorities for four countries within this time span have been found. Moreover, the closeness of the research in developing countries to the developed country have been measured. The experimental results show that for four years, the research topics in Turkey were close to the research topics in the USA on average, and the research topics in Saudi Arabia were close to the USA topics during the past two years. Additionally, the experimental comparison of the proposed method with two clustering baselines indicates the superiority of the proposed method in terms of precision, recall, and accuracy.",

A graph G is said to be t-tough if t center dot omega(G - X) <= |X| for all X subset of V (G) with omega(G - X) > 1. The toughness of G, denoted tau (G), is the maximum value of t such that G is t-tough (taking tau (K-n) = infinity for all n >= 1). It is known that a Hamilton-connected graph G has toughness tau (G) > 1, but that the reverse statement does not hold in general. In this paper, we investigate all possible forbidden subgraphs H such that every H-free graph G with tau (G) > 1 is Hamilton-connected. We find that the results are completely analogous to the Hamiltonian case: every graph H such that any 1-tough H-free graph is Hamiltonian also ensures that every H-free graph with toughness larger than one is Hamilton-connected. And similarly, there is no other forbidden subgraph having this property, except possibly for the graph K-1 ? P-4 itself. We leave this as an open case.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "The digital revolution we are witnessing nowadays goes hand in hand with a revolution in cybercrime. This irrefutable fact has been a major reason for making digital forensic (DF) a pressing and timely topic to investigate. Thanks to the file system which is a rich source of digital evidence that may prove or deny a digital crime. Yet, although there are many tools that can be used to extract potentially conclusive evidence from the file system, there is still a need to develop effective techniques for evaluating the extracted evidence and link it directly to a digital crime. Machine learning can be posed as a possible solution looming in the horizon. This article proposes an Enhanced Multiclass Support Vector Machine (EMSVM) model that aims to improve the classification performance. The EMSVM suggests a new technique in selecting the most effective set of parameters when building a SVM model. In addition, since the DF is considered a multiclass classification problem duo to the fact that a file system might be accecced by more than one application, the EMSVM enhances the class assignment mechanism by supporting multi-class classification. The article then investigates the applicability of the proposed model in analysing incriminating digital evidence by inspecting the historical activities of file systems to realize if a malicious program manipulated them. The results obtained from the proposed model were promising when compared to several machine-learning algorithms.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "Asymptotic distribution theory for maximum likelihood estimators under fixed alternative hypotheses is reported in the literature even though the power of any realistic test converges to one under fixed alternatives. Under fixed alternatives, authors have established that nuisance parameter estimates are inconsistent when sample size re-estimation (SSR) follows blinded randomization. These results have helped to inhibit the use of SSR. In this paper, we argue for local alternatives to be used instead of fixed alternatives. We treat unavailable treatment assignments in blinded experiments as missing data and rely on single imputation from marginal distributions to fill in for missing data. With local alternatives, it is sufficient to proceed only with the first step of the EM algorithm mimicking imputation under the null hypothesis. Then, we show that blinded and unblinded estimates of the nuisance parameter are consistent, and re-estimated sample sizes converge to their locally asymptotically optimal values. This theoretical finding is confirmed through Monte-Carlo simulation studies. Practical utility is illustrated through a multiple logistic regression example. We conclude that, for hypothesis testing with a predetermined minimally clinically relevant local effect size, both blinded and unblinded SSR procedures lead to similar sample sizes and power.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "The notion of a 12-representable graph was introduced by Jones, Kitaev, Pyatkin and Remmel in [Representing graphs via pattern avoiding words, Electron. J. Combin. 22 (2015) #P2.53]. This notion generalizes the notions of the much studied permutation graphs and co-interval graphs. It is known that any 12-representable graph is a comparability graph, and also that a tree is 12-representable if and only if it is a double caterpillar. Moreover, Jones et al. initiated the study of 12- representability of induced subgraphs of a grid graph, and asked whether it is possible to characterize such graphs. This question of Jones et al. is meant to be about induced subgraphs of a grid graph that consist of squares, which we call square grid graphs. However, an induced subgraph in a grid graph does not have to contain entire squares, and we call such graphs line grid graphs. In this paper we answer the question of Jones et al. by providing a complete characterization of 12-representable square grid graphs in terms of forbidden induced subgraphs. Moreover, we conjecture such a characterization for the line grid graphs and give a number of results towards solving this challenging conjecture. Our results are a major step in the direction of characterization of all 12-representable graphs since beyond our characterization, we also discuss relations between graph labelings and 12-representability, one of the key open questions in the area.",

Over half of the studies adopted quantitative methods, and participants were mainly college students. In the before-class stage, the flipped classroom studies in science education mainly adopted instructional videos as the learning materials and used online learning systems as the medium for materials and online discussion. In the in-class stage, the major learning strategy was problem-based learning, while over half of the studies did not employ educational technology. In the after-class stage, most studies administered examinations to explore the learning outcomes. Accordingly, Potential research issues are proposed as a reference for future studies.",

Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is an advance implementation for Internet of Things (IoT). BLE beacons-based indoor positioning systems provide an easy and energy-efficient, low deployment cost solution for wide variety of applications including smart phones. This paper presents an in-depth experimental study of BLE RSSI in a dense indoor environment. Due to noise, fluctuations in RSSI occur, which produces distance estimation error, which ultimately affect position estimation accuracy. The main objective of this paper is to know the variations in RSSI and develop a radio propagation model in order to minimize the distance estimation and position estimation error. Based on our real-time experimental analysis using BLE modules, there is an average 1.32-m position estimation error in the presence of 10-dBm variation in RSSI. Moreover, we also observed that environmental specific radio propagation constants greatly affect distance and position estimation accuracy in BLE modules.",

Although many previous studies have discussed the influencing factors of information security policy compliance behavior in an organization, few have considered the influence of organizational structures. In this study, the mechanism by which information security policy compliance behavioral intention is formed was studied by integrating the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and perceived organizational formalization. Data analysis was performed using the structural equation modeling (SEM) with data obtained from a survey of 261 company employees. The empirical results reveal that perceived organizational formalization significant affected cognitive processes theorized by TPB, behavioral habits, and deterrent certainty. This study suggests that formalized rules, procedures, and communications should be designed to improve employee information security policy compliance behavioral habits and intentions.",

While there are numerous applications of virtualization for off-the-shelf hardware such as security, sandboxing, testing tools, etc. However, there are few open-source virtualization solutions available for embedded systems. For real-time virtualization, good runtime performance is a deterministic factor for its practical use in the embedded domain. In this paper, the internal architecture of HTTM (an open-source type-2 hypervisor for MIPS64 architecture) was thoroughly analyzed. ISA virtualization unit and execution cycle control were two primary units that were profiled and explored for optimization. Dynamic Binary Translation (DBT) unit was modified to generate highly efficient code. While the reduction in switching between the translated code and management layer improved the overall execution cycle. The implementation of these strategies resulted in a 72\u201391% improvement in bandwidth benchmarks. Similarly, latency benchmarks show a 2\u201392% improvement from its vanilla version. Collectively producing an overall 1\u20135 times the improvement in execution time. The performance of optimized HTTM is also compared with Quick Emulator (QEMU). HTTM performs 44\u201380% better than QEMU in bandwidth benchmarks while QEMU performs better in latency operations.",

In various ultrahigh dimensional data, variables are naturally grouped, giving us a good rationale to develop a screening method using joint effect of multiple variables. In this article, we propose a group screening procedure via the F-test statistic. The proposed method is a direct extension of the original sure independence screening procedure, when the group information is known, for example, from prior knowledge. Under certain regularity conditions, we prove that the proposed group screening procedure possesses the sure screening property that selects all effective groups with a probability approaching one at an exponential rate. We use simulations to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method and show its application in a genome-wide association study. We conclude that the grouping method is very useful in the analysis of ultrahigh dimensional data, as the optimal F-test can detect true signals with desired properties.",

It is an efficient optimization algorithm and since demonstrates excellent performance in solving continuous problems, but cannot resolve directly binary optimization problems. Many optimization problems have been modelled as binary problems since their decision variables varied in binary space such as feature selection in data classification. The main goal of feature selection is to find a small size subset of feature from a sizeable original set of features that optimize the classification accuracy. In this paper, a new binary variant of the grasshopper optimization algorithm is proposed and used for the feature subset selection problem. This proposed new binary grasshopper optimization algorithm is tested and compared to five well-known swarm-based algorithms used in feature selection problem. All these algorithms are implemented and experimented assessed on twenty data sets with various sizes. The results demonstrated that the proposed approach could outperform the other tested methods.",

However, generality goes to the detriment of the possibility to model details and peculiarities of a particular application domain. As acknowledged by the literature, known approaches predominantly focus on one aspect between control flow and data, thus neglecting the interplay between the two. Moreover, process instances are not considered or considered in isolation, neglecting, among other aspects, synchronization points among them. As a consequence, the model is an approximation of the real process, limiting its reliability and usefulness in particular domains. This observation emerged clearly in the context of a research project in the construction domain, where preliminary attempts to model inter-company processes show the lack of an appropriate language.",

As the benefits of cloud is attractive, the number of users adopting to the cloud also increases, so the workflow management becomes tedious and more challenging in the cloud. The decision to provide with an enhanced work flow management requires proper scheduling recollecting value of the information. So the paper proposes with an efficient method of managing the work flow considering the value of the information by categorizing between the much value and non-value information's and framing the algorithm that functions as scheduler using the parallel implementation in natural process of genetic algorithm (GA) with secured frame work for the information's of high value.

The model expresses the efficiency of the maintenance by a reduction in the virtual age of the system and a change in the parameters of the failure intensity. Depending on the maintenance decisions, the parameters of the failure intensity may shift and the virtual age of the system is reduced to zero or lower value. Both of Kijima type 1 and Kijima type 2 models were considered in modeling the virtual age of the system. The maximum likelihood estimation is considered to determine the estimation of the model parameters. The obtained results were applied on sets of simulated data, taking into account the left truncated and the right censored cases. In order to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed model, two real data sets were applied, it has been shown that the model can provide a better fit than its sub-models. In some cases, we have seen that the change in the parameters can also change the shape of the hazard function. The confidence intervals for the estimated parameters were obtained using the parametric bootstrap and the bias-corrected accelerated bootstrap methods.",

These methods have a good performance when all the observations follow the assumed model. However, if a small proportion of atypical observations is present in the sample, these estimators become unreliable. A robust estimation method for these models is proposed and applied to two real data sets.

The security and privacy of those data points are very important and considered as a major concern. Due to the resource constraints nature of IoTs, the security solutions for IoTs must be secure and lightweight in terms of processing and storage. However, many existing security solutions specifically in the field of authentication are not suitable for IoTs due to the computation involved. Alternatively, the lightweight existing solutions are vulnerable to various attack(s). In this paper, a lightweight and compromise-resilient authentication (LCA) scheme for IoT is proposed. The proposed LCA scheme is lightweight because it uses lightweight hash and XOR operations. The security analysis manifests that the proposed scheme is compromise resilient against numerous security attacks. The proposed LCA scheme is compared with existing authentication schemes based on execution time, security, and computation cost. The outcomes show that the proposed LCA scheme is more secure and robust as compared to the existing authentication schemes proposed for IoTs.",

However, most current studies lack the joint consideration of economic and security of services in hybrid cloud networks. In this paper, a novel multimedia service optimization mechanism is proposed hereby to meet the user's requirements mentioned above while guaranteeing the reliability of service. Firstly, a credible scheme is designed to help the mobile users distinguish the reliable cloud providers. Meanwhile, a blockchain-based content credibility approach is further designed to guarantee the reliability and integrity of video contents. Moreover, a noncooperative Stackelberg game model is presented to maximize the profit of each party. Furthermore, the equilibrium of this game is achieved by the methods of backward induction and gradient descent. Finally, extensive simulations demonstrate that our solution has efficient performance in terms of secure service ratio, utility, service pricing, etc.",

Pushing designed tweets with specific contains to them is one of the promising ways to solve this problem. In this paper, we developed a new method for high-quality supervision tweet generation, which not only considers the semantics of the tweets but also includes the supervision requirement of different aspects. Firstly, we collect millions of tweets of six typical events. Following, we construct a sentiment lexicon suitable for online behavior analysis, and we also construct a lexicon for tweet preprocessing and emotional score calculation. Secondly, to include the semantics during sentence similarity calculation, we employ the tweets collected to train the word2vec model and employ the sum of the word vectors in specific sentences to form the sentence vector. Finally, we employ the TextRank to generate the supervision tweet. Experimental results based on data collected showed that the proposed methods outperform other related traditional methods, which can be used for effective social security management.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "Recently, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are becoming very famous as they are inexpensive and easy to maintain and manage. The network contains a group of sensor nodes, which are capable of sensing, computing, and transmitting. Energy efficiency is one of the most important challenging problems in WSN. Sensor nodes have inadequate energy and installed in remote areas. Hence, it is difficult to restore the batteries in WSN. Therefore, to maximize the network lifetime, appropriate clustering techniques and cluster head (CH) selection methods should be implemented. The main idea behind the clustering technique is that it clusters the sensor nodes and reduces the composed data simultaneously and then, it broadcasts the data. In this process, CH selection is an essential part. Therefore, this survey paper provides an overview of the clustering techniques for reducing energy consumption by reviewing several CH selection techniques in WSN that provide high energy efficiency. Several techniques have been employed for CH selection based on partitional clustering, optimization, low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy, hierarchical, distributed, and other classification methods. Finally, an analysis is done based on the implementation tools, metrics employed, accuracy, and achievements of the considered CH selection techniques.",

At the time of the information transmission process, node contains high energy, and battery of node may be recharged continuously, which leads to reduction of the entire information transmission system performance. This paper introduces the multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) method with energy-efficient protocol for reducing the energy consumption in the network. Initially, the network coverage is determined by applying the shadow fading sensing model, and the clusters are formed with the help of the particle dual clustering process. After the cluster is formed, the information has been transmitted with the help of the energy-aware peering routing protocol (EPR), which reduces the network traffic and also improves the energy efficiency with efficient manner. Then, the efficiency of the system is analyzed with the help of experimental results in terms of coverage fraction, accuracy of the cluster, and energy consumption.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "An optimal software release strategy is a well-investigated issue in software reliability literature. Comprehensive testing is expected before releasing the software into the market to enhance the reliability and security of the software device. In recent years, few analysts have recommended the scheme for software projects that support releasing the software early in the market and continue the testing process for an added period in the field environment even after the software is distributed. These studies are based on one common assumption that the efficiency of the software engineers in detecting the faults occurs at a consistent rate throughout the testing phase. However, bug-identification rate may experience discontinuity at the software release time. In software engineering, the time-point at which fault detection rate changes is termed as change-point. Consequently, an alternative software release policy is proposed in the present paper, which offers a generalized framework for fault detection phenomenon using the unified approach. An extensive analysis of software time-to-market and testing duration based on cost-efficiency and reliability measures is discussed by considering the change in tester\u2019s fault detection rate. A multi-criteria decision making technique known as multi-attribute utility theory is applied to optimize the software release policy under field-testing (FT) and no field-testing (NFT) frameworks. The relevance of the optimization problem is illustrated using a numerical example, comprising both the exponential and S-shaped bug-detection process.",

We first propose and model the path-flow matching problem, considering the preference ordering, then formulate the problem as a multiobjective optimization problem with the target to ensure the stability and satisfaction from the matching scheme, and design a preference-based path-flow ordering method Extended PIAS, and finally propose a lightweight scheduling algorithm LinkGame based on multiobjective evolutionary algorithm.

Six hundred and sixty-eight college students were invited to complete a self-reported questionnaire measuring TAM constructs and three hypothesized variables drawn from MOOC characteristics. The results from path analysis showed that all path coefficients were statistically significant. Perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment significantly affected students' behavioral intention to use MOOCs, while both perceived usefulness and behavioral intention yielded a significant influence on perceived effective use of MOOCs. Usability and perceived quality had a strong indirect impact on behavioral intention and perceived effective use through the mediators of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment.

Controlling the order release to limit work in process at a stable level and protect throughput from variation is crucial to achieving robustness of manufacturing system performance. To deal with the influences of bottleneck severity and variable resource on system performance, a refined order release method is presented, which releases order periodically based on the corrected aggregate load and continuously based on the bottleneck buffer load. The operational quality of this method with the classical order release method under non-repetitive dynamic manufacturing system is compared by modeling and simulation. The results show that the refined order release method is more robust for general flow shop with higher protective capacity and resource variability.",

Under certain environmental conditions and wildfire situations, burning embers can be lofted across a natural or man-made barrier devoid of fuel, such as a river or road, resulting in new ignitions downwind of the main advancing fire front. This phenomenon, referred to as a \"spot fire\" or \"spotting,\" can put a considerable strain on firefighting operations and pose a grave risk to wildland-urban interface communities. In this article, we formulate the process of spot fire development, and derive the distribution of the time to the first spot fire occurring beyond a barrier to fire spread. A simulator is developed in the framework of generating burning embers from an active wildfire that may result in a spot fire. With the generated data, we demonstrate how to estimate the rate of developing spot fires and identify significant covariates based on data in two practical formats.",

However, the energy is a major challenge in the WSN environment as the battery-operated sensor nodes in the network consumes huge amount of energy during transmission. This work addresses the energy issue and provides an energy efficient multi-hop routing in WSN named Taylor based Cat Salp Swarm Algorithm (Taylor C-SSA) by modifying C-SSA with Taylor series. This method undergoes two stages for attaining multi-hop routing, which includes selection of cluster head (CH), and transmission of data. Initially, the energy-efficient cluster heads are selected using the Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol for effective data transmission, the sensor nodes sends data over the CH, which transmits the data to the base station through the selected optimal hop. The optimal hop selection is done using the proposed Taylor C-SSA. Moreover, the security aware multi-hop routing is performed by introducing trust model that involves indirect trust, integrity factor, direct trust, and data forwarding rate. The proposed Taylor C-SSA algorithm shows best performance in terms of energy, number of alive nodes, delay, and throughput values of 0.129, 42, 0.291, and 0.1, respectively.",

An intrusion detection system is involved extensive mass of data; such data is naturally characterized with repetitions and noise which leads to the reduction in the stability and the accuracy of the intrusion detection system. Hence, the issue of reducing features dimensions for achieving a smaller subset of features which can precisely express the results and status of network observations has attracted a lot of researchers\u2019 attention. In the proposed method, by using gradually feature removal method, 16 critical features were selected for representing various network visits. By combining ant colony algorithm and ensemble of decision trees, we proposed an efficient and stable classifier for judging a network visit to be normal or not. Despite the selection of 16 features, high accuracy, i.e. 99.92%, and the average value of Matthews correlation coefficient 0.91 are obtained.",

Recently, the number of IoT applications has increased dramatically, including smart homes, vehicular ad hoc network (VANETs), health care, smart cities, and wearables. As reported in IHS Markit (see ), the number of connected devices is projected to jump from approximately 27 billion in 2017 to 125 billion in 2030, an average annual increment of 12%. Security is a critical issue in today's IoT field because of the nature of the architecture, the types of devices, different methods of communication (mainly wireless), and the volume of data being transmitted over the network. Security becomes even more important as the number of devices connected to the IoT increases. To overcome the challenges of securing IoT devices, we propose a new deep learning-based intrusion detection system (DL-IDS) to detect security threats in IoT environments. There are many IDSs in the literature, but they lack optimal features learning and data set management, which are significant issues that affect the accuracy of attack detection. Our proposed module combines the spider monkey optimization (SMO) algorithm and the stacked-deep polynomial network (SDPN) to achieve optimal detection recognition; SMO selects the optimal features in the data sets and SDPN classifies the data as normal or anomalies. The types of anomalies detected by DL-IDS include denial of service (DoS), user-to-root (U2R) attack, probe attack, and remote-to-local (R2L) attack. Extensive analysis indicates that the proposed DL-IDS achieves better performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score.",

One collects previous cases, called \"scenarios\", for the set-up in which optimization is being performed, and makes a decision that is optimal for the cases that have been collected. For convex optimization, a solid theory has been developed that provides guarantees of performance, and constraint satisfaction, of the scenario solution. In this paper, we open a new direction of investigation: the risk that a performance is not achieved, or that constraints are violated, is studied jointly with the complexity (as precisely defined in the paper) of the solution. It is shown that the joint probability distribution of risk and complexity is concentrated in such a way that the complexity carries fundamental information to tightly judge the risk. This result is obtained without requiring extra knowledge on the underlying optimization problem than that carried by the scenarios; in particular, no extra knowledge on the distribution by which scenarios are generated is assumed, so that the result is broadly applicable. This deep-seated result unveils a fundamental and general structure of data-driven optimization and suggests practical approaches for risk assessment.",

Data assets are categorized from the PPM standpoint, including (product/customer/ horizontal ellipsis ) master data, transactional data, and interaction data (e.g., IoT data). The study combines literature review and qualitative analysis of eight international companies. The findings underline the crucial role of corporate-widely combined and governed data model. Company business IT is adjusted against the corporate-level data model. The order of importance is data first, and the technology second. The data-driven mind-set and culture creation are also important. The implications include understanding the role and potential of combined data assets that form the basis for data-driven PPM. Facts based on company data assets are essential for decision-making instead of \"gut feeling\" and emotions. The utilization of the unused potential of data assets is promoted in the transformation toward data-driven PPM.",

Given a graph G and a positive integer k, the semitotal domination problem is to decide whether G has a semitotal dominating set of cardinality at most k.

Cellverse is being designed by the Collaborative Learning Environments in Virtual Reality (CLEVR) team, an interdisciplinary team consisting of game designers, educational researchers, and graduate and undergraduate students. Using a design-based research approach, we have enlisted the help of both subject matter experts and user testers to iteratively design and improve Cellverse. The objective of this paper is to share how user and expert feedback can inform and enhance the development of learning games. We describe how we gather and synthesize information to review and revise our game from in-game observations, semi-structured interviews, and video data. We discuss the input of subject matter experts, present feedback from our user testers, and describe how input from both parties influenced the design of Cellverse. Our results suggest that including feedback from both experts and users has provided information that can clarify gameplay, instruction, subject portrayal, narrative, and in-game goals.",

For the widely employed methodologies (e.g. Graphical Lasso), using the sample covariance matrix as an input matrix potentially deteriorates the precision matrix estimation performance in the presence of outliers. We propose several robust alternatives for the covariance matrix, which are constructed by combining robust correlation estimators with robust variation measures. Through extensive numerical studies we demonstrate the robust performance of our proposed approaches compared to the standard methods based on the sample covariance matrix. Further, we apply our proposals to a real data application, aimed at studying the optimal portfolio allocations in Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite index.

In the first part of this paper we give some general lower and upper bounds for the rho-edge stability number. In the second part we study the chi'-edge stability number of graphs, where chi' = chi'(G) is the chromatic index of G.

In this paper, we propose a natural (time) domain technique for the diagnosis of PD. The proposed technique eliminates the need for transformation of the signal to other domains by extracting the feature of electroencephalography signals in the time domain. We hypothesize that two inter-channel similarity features, correlation coefficients and linear predictive coefficients, are able to detect the PD signals automatically using support vector machines classifier with third degree polynomial kernel. A progressive feature addition analysis is employed using selected features obtained based on the feature ranking and principal component analysis techniques. The proposed approach is able to achieve a maximum accuracy of 99.1 +/- 0.1%. The presented computer-aided diagnosis system can act as an assistive tool to confirm the finding of PD by the clinicians.",

In this paper, we propose an Energy Efficient Distributed Lightweight Authentication and Encryption (EEDLAE) technique for IoT security. In our proposed technique, the receiver generates the token for each sender. The token expiration time is determined based on the trust value of each sender, and sleep period of the receiver radio is determined based on its remaining energy. For encryption, Counter with Cipher Block Chaining-Message Authentication Code (CCM) is applied. Experimental results show that EEDLAE technique can hold out against affected packets, higher resilience against node capture, increased throughput, and residual energy, compared with the existing technique.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "In this paper, a fuzzy commitment scheme is applied with a machine vision gait-based biometric system to enhance system security. The proposed biometric cryptosystem has two phases: enrolment and verification. Each of them comprises three main stages: feature extraction, reliable components extraction, and fuzzy commitment scheme. Gait features are extracted from gait images using local ternary pattern (LTP), and then, the average of one complete gait cycle using the gait energy image (GEl) concept is calculated. The average images are joined using a 2D joint histogram, which is reduced using principal component analysis (PCA) to produce the final feature vector. To enhance the robustness of the system, only highly robust and reliable bits from the feature vector are extracted. Finally, the fuzzy commitment scheme is used to secure feature templates. Bose\u2013Chaudhuri\u2013Hocquenghem codes (BCH) are used for key encoding in the enrolment phase and for decoding in the verification phase. The proposed system is tested using the CMU MoBo and CASIA A databases. The experimental results show that the best error rate for the CMU MoBo database is obtained when using a fast walk for enrolment and verification, where we obtain 0% for the false acceptance rate (FAR) and 0% for the false rejection rate (FRR) for a key length equal to 50 bits. The best error rate for CASIA A dataset is obtained when using the 45-degree direction to the image plane view for enrolment and verification, where we obtain 0% for the false acceptance rate (FAR) and 0% for the false rejection rate (FRR) for a key length equal to 45 bits.",

The solution to the problem is a planting schedule for crops to be cultivated in predefined plots, in order to minimize the possibility of pest proliferation and maximize the profit of this process. Biological constraints were also considered. Exact methods, based on the nonlinear model and on a linearization of that model were proposed to generate Pareto optimal solutions for the problem of sustainable cultivation, along with a metaheuristic approach for the problem based on a genetic algorithm and on constructive heuristics. The methods were tested using semi-randomly generated instances to simulate real situations. According to the experimental results, the exact methodologies performed favorably for small and medium size instances. The heuristic method was able to potentially determine Pareto optimal solutions of good quality, in a reduced computational time, even for high dimension instances. Therefore, the mathematical models and the methods proposed may support a powerful methodology for this complex decision-making problem.",

Unsatisfied scenarios can enter a recovery mode. This class corresponds to problems that can be reformulated as deterministic convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems with indicator variables and continuous scenario variables, but the size of the reformulation is large and quickly becomes impractical as the number of scenarios grows. The Branch-and-Cut algorithm is based on an implicit Benders decomposition scheme, where we generate cutting planes as outer approximation cuts from the projection of the feasible region on suitable subspaces. The size of the master problem in our scheme is much smaller than the deterministic reformulation of the chance-constrained problem. We apply the Branch-and-Cut algorithm to the mid-term hydro scheduling problem, for which we propose a chance-constrained formulation. A computational study using data from ten hydroplants in Greece shows that the proposed methodology solves instances faster than applying a general-purpose solver for convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problems to the deterministic reformulation, and scales much better with the number of scenarios.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "The increasing adoption of modelling methods contributes to a better understanding of the flow of processes, from the internal behaviour of a single organisation to a wider perspective where several organisations exchange messages. In this regard, BPMN collaborations provide a suitable modelling abstraction. Even if this is a widely accepted notation, only a limited effort has been expended in formalising its semantics, especially for what it concerns the interplay among control features, data handling and exchange of messages in scenarios requiring multiple instances of interacting participants. In this paper, we face the problem of providing a formal semantics for BPMN collaborations including elements dealing with multiple instances, i.e., multi-instance pools and sequential/parallel multi-instance tasks. For an accurate account of these features, it is necessary to consider the data perspective of collaboration models, thus supporting data objects, data collections and data stores, and different execution modalities of tasks concerning atomicity and concurrency. Beyond defining a novel formalisation, we also provide a BPMN collaboration animator tool, named MIDA, faithfully implementing the formal semantics. MIDA can also support designers in debugging multi-instance collaboration models.",

    "original_csv_abstract": "Under rapid urbanization, cities are facing many societal challenges that impede sustainability. Big data analytics (BDA) gives cities unprecedented potential to address these issues. As BDA is still a new concept, there is limited knowledge on how to apply BDA in a sustainability context. Thus, this study investigates a case using BDA for sustainability, adopting the resource orchestration perspective. A process model is generated, which provides novel insights into three aspects: data resource orchestration, BDA capability development, and big data value creation. This study benefits both researchers and practitioners by contributing to theoretical developments as well as by providing practical insights.",
