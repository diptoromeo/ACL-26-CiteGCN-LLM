  CSV Title: Tidal range energy resource and optimization – Past perspectives and future challenges
  CSV Abstract: Tidal energy is one of the most predictable forms of renewable energy. Although there has been much commercial and R&D progress in tidal stream energy, tidal range is a more mature technology, with tidal range power plants having a history that extends back over 50 years. With the 2017 publication of the “Hendry Review” that examined the feasibility of tidal lagoon power plants in the UK, it is timely to review tidal range power plants. Here, we explain the main principles of tidal range power plants, and review two main research areas: the present and future tidal range resource, and the optimization of tidal range power plants. We also discuss how variability in the electricity generated from tidal range power plants could be partially offset by the development of multiple power plants (e.g. lagoons) that are complementary in phase, and by the provision of energy storage. Finally, we discuss the implications of the Hendry Review, and what this means for the future of tidal range power plants in the UK and internationally.

  CSV Title: Linking microstructure and local mechanical properties in SiC-SiC fiber composite using micromechanical testing
  CSV Abstract:  Local mechanical properties of SiC-SiC fiber-reinforced composite – matrix, fiber and interphases – were evaluated using nanoindentation and microcantilever fracture testing. The fracture toughness was found to be ∼4.25 MPa*m 1/2 in the matrix, ∼2 MPa*m 1/2 in the fibers and ∼0.8 MPa*m 1/2 at the interphases. Nanoindentation hardness was found to vary from ∼17 GPa in the center of the fibers to ∼40 GPa in the matrix. Values obtained with micromechanical testing were found to be in good agreement with the available data on bulk mechanical properties. The mechanical property variations in the different components of the composite can be explained by the variations in the microstructure. The matrix has complex hierarchical microstructure with elongated grains, often featuring twinning, growing radially from the fibers in predominantly <111> direction and forming sets of concentric rings around them. The fibers contain equiaxed grains with carbon precipitates at the grain boundaries. It was found that in the matrix fracture is transgranular, while in the fibers it can be both trans- and intergranular; at the interphases the fracture occurs at the carbon-fiber boundary. The differences in mechanical properties between the matrix and the fibers are attributed to the presence of carbon inclusions in the fibers, which reduce both hardness and fracture toughness.

  CSV Title: The effects of remote ischaemic preconditioning on coronary artery function in patients with stable coronary artery disease
  CSV Abstract: Background Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a cardioprotective intervention invoking intermittent periods of ischaemia in a tissue or organ remote from the heart. The mechanisms of this effect are incompletely understood. We hypothesised that RIPC might enhance coronary vasodilatation by an endothelium-dependent mechanism. Methods We performed a prospective, randomised, sham-controlled, blinded clinical trial. Patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing elective invasive management were prospectively enrolled, and randomised to RIPC or sham (1:1) prior to angiography. Endothelial-dependent vasodilator function was assessed in a non-target coronary artery with intracoronary infusion of incremental acetylcholine doses (10− 6, 10− 5, 10− 4 mol/l). Venous blood was sampled pre- and post-RIPC or sham, and analysed for circulating markers of endothelial function. Coronary luminal diameter was assessed by quantitative coronary angiography. The primary outcome was the between-group difference in the mean percentage change in coronary luminal diameter following the maximal acetylcholine dose (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02666235). Results 75 patients were enrolled. Following angiography, 60 patients (mean ± SD age 57.5 ± 8.5 years; 80% male) were eligible and completed the protocol (n = 30 RIPC, n = 30 sham). The mean percentage change in coronary luminal diameter was − 13.3 ± 22.3% and − 2.0 ± 17.2% in the sham and RIPC groups respectively (difference 11.32%, 95%CI: 1.2– 21.4, p = 0.032). This remained significant when age and sex were included as covariates (difference 11.01%, 95%CI: 1.01– 21.0, p = 0.035). There were no between-group differences in endothelial-independent vasodilation, ECG parameters or circulating markers of endothelial function. Conclusions RIPC attenuates the extent of vasoconstriction induced by intracoronary acetylcholine infusion. This endothelium-dependent mechanism may contribute to the cardioprotective effects of RIPC.

  CSV Title: Comparison of the sliding wear behaviour of self-mated HIPed Stellite 3 and Stellite 6 in a simulated PWR water environment
  CSV Abstract:  Cobalt-based alloys such as Stellite 3 and Stellite 6 are widely used to protect stainless steel surfaces in primary circuit nuclear reactor applications where high resistance to wear and corrosion are required. In this study, self-mated sliding wear of Stellite 3 and Stellite 6 consolidated by hot isostatic pressing were compared. Tests were performed with a pin-on-disc apparatus enclosed in a water-submerged autoclave environment and wear was measured from room temperature up to 250 °C (a representative pressurized water reactor environment). Both alloys exhibit a microstructure of micron-sized carbides embedded in a cobalt-rich matrix. Stellite 3 (higher tungsten and carbon content) contains M 7 C 3 and an eta (η) -carbide whereas Stellite 6 contains only M 7 C 3 . Furthermore, the former has a significantly higher carbide volume fraction and hardness than the latter. Both alloys show a significant increase in the wear rate as the temperature is increased but Stellite 3 has a higher wear resistance over the entire range; at 250 °C the wear rate of Stellite 6 is more than five times that of Stellite 3. There is only a minimal formation of a transfer layer on the sliding surfaces but electron backscatter diffraction on cross-sections through the wear scar revealed that wear causes partial transformation of the cobalt matrix from fcc to hcp in both alloys over the entire temperature range. It is proposed that the acceleration of wear with increasing temperature in the range studied is associated with a tribocorrosion mechanism and that the higher carbide fraction in Stellite 3 resulted in its reduced wear rate compared to Stellite 6.

  CSV Title: Multiscale synchrotron scattering studies of the temperature-dependent changes in the structure and deformation response of a thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer
  CSV Abstract: The distinct molecular architecture and thermomechanical properties of polyurethane block copolymers make them suitable for applications ranging from textile fibers to temperature sensors. In the present study, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis and macroscopic stress relaxation measurements are used to identify the key internal processes occurring in the temperature ranges between −10 °C and 0 °C and between 60 °C and 70 °C. The underlying physical phenomena are elucidated by the small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) study of synchrotron beams, allowing the exploration of the structure-property relationships as a function of temperature. In situ multiscale deformation analysis under uniaxial cyclic thermomechanical loading reveals a significant anomaly in the strain evolution at the nanoscale (assessed via SAXS) in the range between −10 °C and 0 °C owing to the ‘melting’ of the soft matrix. Furthermore, WAXS measurement of crystal strain within the hard regions reveals significant compressive residual strains arising from unloading at ∼60 °C, which are associated with the dynamic shape memory effect in polyurethane at these temperatures.

  CSV Title: Visualising uncertainty: Examining women's views on the role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in late pregnancy
  CSV Abstract: Prenatal screening occupies a prominent role within sociological debates on medical uncertainty. A particular issue concerns the limitations of routine screening which tends to be based on risk prediction. Computer assisted visual technologies such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are now starting to be applied to the prenatal realm to assist in the diagnosis of a range of fetal and maternal disorders (from problems with the fetal brain to the placenta). MRI is often perceived in popular and medical discourse as a technology of certainty and truth. However, little is known about the use of MRI as a tool to confirm or refute the diagnosis of a range of disorders in pregnancy. Drawing on qualitative research with pregnant women attending a fetal medicine clinic in the North of England this paper examines the potential role that MRI can play in mediating pregnancy uncertainty. The paper will argue that MRI can create and manage women's feelings of uncertainty during pregnancy. However, while MRI may not always provide women with unequivocal answers, the detailed information provided by MR images combined with the interpretation and communication skills of the radiologist in many ways enables women to navigate the issue. Our analysis of empirical data therefore highlights the value of this novel technological application for women and their partners. It also seeks to stress the merit of taking a productive approach to the study of diagnostic uncertainty, an approach which recognises the concepts dual nature.

  CSV Title: Biomechanical Flow Amplification Arising From the Variable Deformation of the Subglottic Mucosa
  CSV Abstract: Objective This study mapped the variation in tissue elasticity of the subglottic mucosa, applied these data to provide initial models of the likely deformation of the mucosa during the myoelastic cycle, and hypothesized as to the impact on the process of phonation. Study Design Six donor human larynges were dissected along the sagittal plane to expose the vocal folds and subglottic mucosa. A linear skin rheometer was used to apply a controlled shear force, and the resultant displacement was measured. These data provided a measure of the stress/strain characteristics of the tissue at each anatomic point. A series of measurements were taken at 2-mm interval inferior of the vocal folds, and the change in elasticity was determined. Results It was found that the elasticity of the mucosa in the subglottic region increased linearly with distance from the vocal folds in all 12 samples. A simple deformation model indicated that under low pressure conditions the subglottic mucosa will deform to form a cone, which could result in a higher velocity, thus amplifying the low pressure effect resulting from the Venturi principle, and could assist in maintaining laminar flow. Conclusions This study indicated that the deformation of the subglottic mucosa could play a significant role in the delivery of a low pressure airflow over the vocal folds. A large scale study will now be undertaken to secure more data to evaluate this hypothesis, and using computational fluid dynamics based on actual three-dimensional structure obtained from computed tomography scans the aerodynamics of this region will be investigated.

  CSV Title: Evaluation and calibration of Aeroqual series 500 portable gas sensors for accurate measurement of ambient ozone and nitrogen dioxide
  CSV Abstract: Low-power, and relatively low-cost, gas sensors have potential to improve understanding of intra-urban air pollution variation by enabling data capture over wider networks than is possible with 'traditional' reference analysers. We evaluated an Aeroqual Ltd. Series 500 semiconducting metal oxide O3 and an electrochemical NO2 sensor against UK national network reference analysers for more than 2months at an urban background site in central Edinburgh. Hourly-average Aeroqual O3 sensor observations were highly correlated (R2=0.91) and of similar magnitude to observations from the UV-absorption reference O3 analyser. The Aeroqual NO2 sensor observations correlated poorly with the reference chemiluminescence NO2 analyser (R2=0.02), but the deviations between Aeroqual and reference analyser values ([NO2]Aeroq-[NO2]ref) were highly significantly correlated with concurrent Aeroqual O3 sensor observations [O3]Aeroq. This permitted effective linear calibration of the [NO2]Aeroq data, evaluated using 'hold out' subsets of the data (R2≥0.85). These field observations under temperate environmental conditions suggest that the Aeroqual Series 500 NO2 and O3 monitors have good potential to be useful ambient air monitoring instruments in urban environments provided that the O3 and NO2 gas sensors are calibrated against reference analysers and deployed in parallel.

  CSV Title: Climatization: A critical perspective of framing disasters as climate change events
  CSV Abstract: In recent years, there has been a developing trend of labelling some disasters as '. climate change disasters'. In doing so, a discursive phenomenon can emerge that the authors have coined '. climatization' which is specified as framing a disastrous event or degraded environmental condition as caused by climate change, in order to reach an intended goal or to distract the discussion from the real problem which might have a different root course than caused by the climate change effects.The implications of climatization are currently unclear - particularly to what extent climatizing a disaster might increase or decrease the vulnerability of a population at risk of disaster. The purpose of this paper is thus to open up the concept of climatization to investigation, and examine what affect such a discursive framing might have on public and political perception.Climatization is here discussed in the context of Bangladesh - a country that is expected to be among the worst affected by climate change and a country in which some people claim the effects of climate change can already be seen. A qualitative field study which included key informant interviews, focus group discussions and a literature review was conducted in Bangladesh.The study found recent examples of climatization related to Cyclone Aila (2009) and salt water intrusion in Bangladesh. In most cases these disasters were climatized in order to create a sense of urgency in order to push for an increase in financial aid to Bangladesh and to deflect responsibility for inaction that led up to the disaster. This study urges caution as there is a potential for climatization to be used as a means to cover up negligence or bad management and there is a risk that by climatizing a disaster key vulnerabilities may be overlooked.

  CSV Abstract: Access to climate and spatial datasets by non-specialists is restricted by technical barriers involving hardware, software and data formats. We discuss an open-source online tool that facilitates downloading the climate data from the global circulation models used by the Inter-Sectoral Impacts Model Intercomparison Project. The tool also offers temporal and spatial aggregation capabilities for incorporating future climate scenarios in applications where spatial aggregation is important. We hope that streamlined access to these data facilitates analysis of climate related issues while considering the uncertainties derived from future climate projections and temporal aggregation choices.

  CSV Title: Environmental footprint family to address local to planetary sustainability and deliver on the SDGs
  CSV Abstract: The number of publications on environmental footprint indicators has been growing rapidly, but with limited efforts to integrate different footprints into a coherent framework. Such integration is important for comprehensive understanding of environmental issues, policy formulation and assessment of trade-offs between different environmental concerns. Here, we systematize published footprint studies and define a family of footprints that can be used for the assessment of environmental sustainability. We identify overlaps between different footprints and analyse how they relate to the nine planetary boundaries and visualize the crucial information they provide for local and planetary sustainability. In addition, we assess how the footprint family delivers on measuring progress towards Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), considering its ability to quantify environmental pressures along the supply chain and relating them to the water-energy-food-ecosystem (WEFE) nexus and ecosystem services. We argue that the footprint family is a flexible framework where particular members can be included or excluded according to the context or area of concern. Our paper is based upon a recent workshop bringing together global leading experts on existing environmental footprint indicators.

This study aimed to assess the effects of the National Schistosomiasis Control Programme on prevalence of taeniosis and porcine cysticercosis over a four year period in Tanzania. School-based mass drug administration (MDA) of praziquantel was carried out based on schistosomiasis endemicity. Four human and five porcine cross-sectional surveys were carried out from 2012 to 2015 in Mbozi and Mbeya district in Tanzania. Three rounds of school-based MDA of praziquantel were delivered in Mbozi and two in Mbeya. The prevalence of taeniosis and porcine cysticercosis was estimated annually. Stool samples were collected from humans and prevalence of taeniosis estimated by copro-Ag-ELISA. Blood samples from pigs were collected to estimate cysticercosis prevalence by Ag-ELISA. “Track-and-treat” of taeniosis cases was carried out after each survey. In total 12082 stool samples and 4579 porcine serum samples were collected. Significantly fewer children (≤ 15) from Mbozi were infected throughout the study than children from Mbeya who showed a significant decrease in copro-Ag prevalence after the first treatment only. During the final survey in Mbozi the prevalence of taeniosis in adults (1.8%) was significantly lower (p = 0.031, OR 0.40, CI: 0.17–0.89), compared to baseline (4.1%). The prevalence of porcine cysticercosis (8%) had also dropped significantly (p = 0.002, OR 0.49, CI: 0.32–0.76) in this district compared to baseline (13%), whereas no significant difference was seen in Mbeya compared to baseline. The study suggests that three rounds of MDA targeting schistosomiasis in school-aged children combined with ‘track-and-treat’ contributed to a reduction in prevalence of T. solium in this population, and also had a spillover effect on adults in treated areas as well as reducing the prevalence of T. solium in the intermediate pig host population. Elimination of T. solium in this area would require a One Health approach.

  CSV Title: Validations of apomorphine-induced BOLD activation correlations in hemiparkinsonian rhesus macaques
  CSV Abstract:  Identification of Parkinson's disease at the earliest possible stage of the disease may provide the best opportunity for the use of disease modifying treatments. However, diagnosing the disease during the pre-symptomatic period remains an unmet goal. To that end, we used pharmacological MRI (phMRI) to assess the function of the cortico-basal ganglia circuit in a non-human primate model of dopamine deficiency to determine the possible relationships between phMRI signals with behavioral, neurochemical, and histological measurements. Animals with unilateral treatments with the neurotoxin, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), that expressed stable, long-term hemiparkinsonism were challenged with the dopaminergic receptor agonist, apomorphine, and structure-specific phMRI blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activation responses were measured. Behavioral, histopathological, and neurochemical measurements were obtained and correlated with phMRI activation of structures of the cortico-basal ganglia system. Greater phMRI activations in the basal ganglia and cortex were associated with slower movement speed, decreased daytime activity, or more pronounced parkinsonian features. Animals showed decreased stimulus-evoked dopamine release in the putamen and substantia nigra pars compacta and lower basal glutamate levels in the motor cortex on the MPTP-lesioned hemisphere compared to the contralateral hemisphere. The altered neurochemistry was significantly correlated with phMRI signals in the motor cortex and putamen. Finally, greater phMRI activations in the caudate nucleus correlated with fewer tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH + ) nigral cells and decreased TH + fiber density in the putamen. These results reveal the correlation of phMRI signals with the severity of the motor deficits and pathophysiological changes in the cortico-basal ganglia circuit.

  CSV Title: Acid acceleration of hydrogen generation using seawater as a reactant
  CSV Abstract: The present study describes hydrogen generation from NaBH4 in the presence of acid accelerator, boric oxide or B2O3, using seawater as a reactant. Reaction times and temperatures are adjusted using various delivery methods: bulk, addition funnel, and metering pump. It is found that the transition metal catalysts typically used to generate hydrogen gas are poisoned by seawater. B2O3 is not poisoned by seawater; in fact, reaction times are considerably faster in seawater using B2O3. Reaction times and temperatures are compared for pure water and seawater for each delivery method. It is found that using B2O3 with pure water, bulk addition is 97% complete in 3 min; pump metering provides a convenient method to extend the time to 27 min, a factor of 9 increase above bulk addition. Using B2O3 with seawater as a reactant, bulk addition is 97% complete in 1.35 min; pump metering extends the time to 23 min, a factor of 17 increase above bulk. A second acid accelerator, sodium bisulfate or NaHSO4, is investigated here for use with NaBH4 in seawater. Because it is non-reactive in seawater, i.e., no spontaneous H2 generation, NaHSO4 can be stored as a solution in seawater; because of its large solubility, it is ready to be metered into NaBH4. With NaHSO4 in seawater, pump metering increases the time to 97% completion from 3.4 min to 21 min. Metering allows the instantaneous flow rate of H2, and reaction times and temperatures, to be tailored to a particular application. In one application, the seawater hydrogen generator characterized here is ideal for supplying H2 gas directly to Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cells in sea surface or subsea environments where a reliable source of power is needed.

  CSV Title: Archival biogenic micro- and nanostructure data analysis: Signatures of diagenetic systems
  CSV Abstract: The present data in brief article provides additional data and information to our research article “Micro- and nanostructures reflect the degree of diagenetic alteration in modern and fossil brachiopod shell calcite: a multi-analytical screening approach (CL, FE-SEM, AFM, EBSD)” [1] (Casella et al.). We present fibre morphology, nano- and microstructure, as well as calcite crystal orientations and textures found in pristine, experimentally altered (hydrothermal and thermal), and diagenetically overprinted brachiopod shells. Combination of the screening tools AFM, FE-SEM, and EBSD allows to observe a significant change in microstructural and textural features with an increasing degree of laboratory-based and naturally occurring diagenetic alteration. Amalgamation of neighbouring fibres was observed on the micrometre scale level, whereas progressive decomposition of biopolymers in the shells and fusion of nanoparticulate calcite crystals was detected on the nanometre scale. The presented data in this article and the study described in [1] allows for qualitative information on the degree of diagenetic alteration of fossil archives used for palaeoclimate reconstruction.

  CSV Title: A high-compression electron gun for C6+ production: concept, simulations and mechanical design
  CSV Abstract: In this paper we report on simulations and the mechanical design of a high-compression electron gun for an Electron Beam Ion Source (EBIS) dedicated for production of high intensity and high repetition rate pulses of bare carbon ions for injection into linac-based hadron therapy facilities. The gun is presently under construction at CERN to be retrofitted into the TwinEBIS test bench for experimental studies. We describe the design constraints, show results of numeric simulations and report on the mechanical design featuring several novel ideas. The reported design makes use of combined-function units with reduced number of mechanical joints that were carefully controlled and tuned during the manufacturing phase. The simulations addressed a wide range of topics including the influence of thermal effects, focusing optics, symmetry-breaking misalignments and injection into a full 5 T field.

  CSV Title: Deaths from acute abdominal conditions and geographical access to surgical care in India: A nationally representative spatial analysis
  CSV Abstract: Background: Few population-based studies quantify mortality from surgical conditions and relate mortality to access to surgical care in low-income and middle-income countries. Methods: We linked deaths from acute abdominal conditions within a nationally representative, population-based mortality survey of 1·1 million households in India to nationally representative facility data. We calculated total and age-standardised death rates for acute abdominal conditions. Using 4064 postal codes, we undertook a spatial clustering analysis to compare geographical access to well-resourced government district hospitals (24 h surgical and anaesthesia services, blood bank, critical care beds, basic laboratory, and radiology) in high-mortality or low-mortality clusters from acute abdominal conditions. Findings: 923 (1·1%) of 86 806 study deaths at ages 0-69 years were identified as deaths from acute abdominal conditions, corresponding to 72 000 deaths nationally in 2010 in India. Most deaths occurred at home (71%) and in rural areas (87%). Compared with 567 low-mortality geographical clusters, the 393 high-mortality clusters had a nine times higher age-standardised acute abdominal mortality rate and significantly greater distance to a well-resourced hospital. The odds ratio (OR) of being a high-mortality cluster was 4·4 (99% CI 3·2-6·0) for living 50 km or more from well-resourced district hospitals (rising to an OR of 16·1 [95% CI 7·9-32·8] for >100 km). No such relation was seen for deaths from non-acute surgical conditions (ie, oral, breast, and uterine cancer). Interpretation: Improvements in human and physical resources at existing government hospitals are needed to reduce deaths from acute abdominal conditions in India. Full access to well-resourced hospitals within 50 km by all of India's population could have avoided about 50 000 deaths from acute abdominal conditions, and probably more from other emergency surgical conditions.

  CSV Title: Sex-specific hippocampal metabolic signatures at the onset of systemic inflammation with lipopolysaccharide in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease
  CSV Abstract: Systemic inflammation enhances the risk and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent pro-inflammatory endotoxin produced by the gut, is found in excess levels in AD where it associates with neurological hallmarks of pathology. Sex differences in susceptibility to inflammation and AD progression have been reported, but how this impacts on LPS responses remains under investigated. We previously reported in an APP/PS1 model of AD that systemic LPS administration rapidly altered hippocampal metabolism in males. Here, we used untargeted metabolomics to comprehensively identify hippocampal metabolic processes occurring at onset of systemic inflammation with LPS (100 µg/kg, i.v.) in APP/PS1 mice, at an early pathological stage, and investigated the sexual dimorphism in this response. Four hours after LPS administration, pathways regulating energy metabolism, immune and oxidative stress responses were simultaneously recruited in the hippocampi of 4.5-month-old mice with a more protective response in females despite their pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant metabolic signature in the absence of immune stimulation. LPS induced comparable behavioural sickness responses in male and female wild-type and APP/PS1 mice and comparable activation of both the serotonin and nicotinamide pathways of tryptophan metabolism in their hippocampi. Elevations in N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide, a major toxic metabolite of nicotinamide, correlated with behavioural sickness regardless of sex, as well as with the LPS-induced hypothermia seen in males. Males also exhibited a pro-inflammatory-like downregulation of pyruvate metabolism, exacerbated in APP/PS1 males, and methionine metabolism whereas females showed a greater cytokine response and anti-inflammatory-like downregulation of hippocampal methylglyoxal and methionine metabolism. Metabolic changes were not associated with morphological markers of immune cell activation suggesting that they constitute an early event in the development of LPS-induced neuroinflammation and AD exacerbation. These data suggest that the female hippocampus is more tolerant to acute systemic inflammation.

  CSV Title: Public acceptability of nudging and taxing to reduce consumption of alcohol, tobacco, and food: A population-based survey experiment
  CSV Abstract: There is growing evidence for the effectiveness of choice architecture or ‘nudge’ interventions to change a range of behaviours including the consumption of alcohol, tobacco and food. Public acceptability is key to implementing these and other interventions. However, few studies have assessed public acceptability of these interventions, including the extent to which acceptability varies with the type of intervention, the target behaviour and with evidence of intervention effectiveness. These were assessed in an online study using a between-participants full factorial design with three factors: Policy (availability vs size vs labelling vs tax) x Behaviour (alcohol consumption vs tobacco use vs high-calorie snack food consumption) x Evidence communication (no message vs assertion of policy effectiveness vs assertion and quantification of policy effectiveness [e.g., a 10% change in behaviour]). Participants (N = 7058) were randomly allocated to one of the 36 groups. The primary outcome was acceptability of the policy. Acceptability differed across policy, behaviour and evidence communication (all ps <.001). Labelling was the most acceptable policy (supported by 78%) and Availability the least (47%). Tobacco use was the most acceptable behaviour to be targeted by policies (73%) compared with policies targeting Alcohol (55%) and Food (54%). Relative to the control group (60%), asserting evidence of effectiveness increased acceptability (63%); adding a quantification to this assertion did not significantly increase this further (65%). Public acceptability for nudges and taxes to improve population health varies with the behaviour targeted and the type of intervention but is generally favourable. Communicating that these policies are effective can increase support by a small but significant amount, suggesting that highlighting effectiveness could contribute to mobilising public demand for policies. While uncertainty remains about the strength of public support needed, this may help overcome political inertia and enable action on behaviours that damage population and planetary health.

  CSV Title: Associations between age discrimination and health and wellbeing: cross-sectional and prospective analysis of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing
  CSV Abstract: Background: Age discrimination (or ageism) is pervasive in society. Other forms of discrimination (such as racism) have been linked with adverse health outcomes, but age discrimination has not been well studied in public health. We aimed to examine associations between perceived age discrimination and health and wellbeing in England. Methods: We did a longitudinal observational population study with data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, a nationally representative sample of older men and women. Participants were aged 50 years or older and reported experiences of age discrimination via a face-to-face computer-assisted personal interview and a self-completed questionnaire between July, 2010, and June, 2011. Self-rated health, chronic health conditions, and depressive symptoms were assessed between July, 2010, and June, 2011, and between May, 2016, and June, 2017. We used logistic regression to test cross-sectional associations between perceived age discrimination and baseline health status and prospective associations between perceived age discrimination and incident ill health over 6 years. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and wealth. Findings: Our sample for cross-sectional analyses of 2010–11 data comprised 7731 people who took part in the face-to-face interview, returned the self-completion questionnaire, and had available data for age discrimination. Perceived age discrimination was reported by 1943 (25·1%) participants. Patients who perceived age discrimination were more likely to self-report fair or poor health (odds ratio [OR] 1·32 [95% CI 1·17–1·48]) and to have coronary heart disease (1·33 [1·14–1·54]), chronic lung disease (1·37 [1·11–1·69]), arthritis (1·27 [1·14–1·41]), limiting long-standing illness (1·35 [1·21–1·51]), and depressive symptoms (1·81 [1·57–2·08]) than those who did not perceive age discrimination. Follow-up data collected 6 years after the baseline assessment were available for 5595 participants. Longitudinally, perceived age discrimination was associated with the deterioration of self-rated health (OR 1·32 [95% CI 1·10–1·58]) and incident coronary heart disease (1·66 [1·18–2·35]), stroke (1·48 [1·08–2·10]), diabetes (1·33 [1·01–1·75]), chronic lung disease (1·50 [1·10–2·04]), limiting long-standing illness (1·32 [1·10–1·57]), and depressive symptoms (1·47 [1·16–1·86]) over 6 years. Interpretation: Among older adults living in England, perceived age discrimination was associated with increased odds of poor self-rated health and risk of incident serious health problems over a 6-year period. These findings underscore the need for effective interventions at the population level to combat age stigma and discrimination. Funding: UK Economic and Social Research Council.

  CSV Title: Role for serotonin2A (5-HT2A) and 2C (5-HT2C) receptors in experimental absence seizures
  CSV Abstract: Absence seizures (ASs) are the hallmark of childhood/juvenile absence epilepsy. Monotherapy with first-line anti-absence drugs only controls ASs in 50% of patients, indicating the need for novel therapeutic targets. Since serotonin family-2 receptors (5-HT2Rs) are known to modulate neuronal activity in the cortico-thalamo-cortical loop, the main network involved in AS generation, we investigated the effect of selective 5-HT2AR and 5-HT2CR ligands on ASs in the Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS), a well established polygenic rat model of these non-convulsive seizures. GAERS rats were implanted with fronto-parietal EEG electrodes under general anesthesia, and their ASs were later recorded under freely moving conditions before and after intraperitoneal administration of various 5-HT2AR and 5-HT2CR ligands. The 5-HT2A agonist TCB-2 dose-dependently decreased the total time spent in ASs, an effect that was blocked by the selective 5-HT2A antagonist MDL11,939. Both MDL11,939 and another selective 5-HT2A antagonist (M100,907) increased the length of individual seizures when injected alone. The 5-HT2C agonists lorcaserin and CP-809,101 dose-dependently suppressed ASs, an effect blocked by the selective 5-HT2C antagonist SB 242984. In summary, 5-HT2ARs and 5-HT2CRs negatively control the expression of experimental ASs, indicating that selective agonists at these 5-HT2R subtypes might be potential novel anti-absence drugs.

  CSV Title: Rice husk combustion characteristics in a rectangular fluidized-bed combustor with triple pairs of chevron-shaped discrete ribbed walls
  CSV Abstract: An experimental combustion work using the rice husk as a fuel was performed in a rectangular fluidized bed combustor with triple pairs of chevron-shaped discrete ribbed walls. The effect of percent excess air (EA = 40%-70%) on temperature distribution and gas emissions in a rectangular fluidized-bed combustor on combustion behaviors (temperature distributions inside the bed, exhaust gas emissions and combustion efficiency) is reported. The free-board had a rectangular shape which modified by increasing the chamber size from 300 × 100 mm2 to 600 × 200 mm2 or two times of the bottom chamber and 2400 mm in height. Triple pairs of rib configurations, namely, 30° chevron-shaped discrete ribbed walls were introduced and placed in the bottom part of the combustion chamber to generate counter-rotating vortices in the chamber. The results show that the fluidized bed combustor with 30° chevron-shaped discrete ribbed walls at 40% percent excess air provides the higher temperature than other of 861 °C. Among the studied excess air percentages, the highest combustion efficiency of 99.2% is obtained at EA = 60%. In addition, combustion at EA = 60% shows the lowest emissions CO, CO2, O2 and NOx of 236.8%Vol, 2.55 ppm, 13.53 %Vol, 110.2 ppm, respectively.

  CSV Title: A systematic review with epidemiological update of male genital schistosomiasis (MGS): A call for integrated case management across the health system in sub-Saharan Africa
  CSV Abstract: Male genital schistosomiasis (MGS) is a gender specific manifestation of urogenital schistosomiasis (UGS) first described in 1911 by Madden in Egypt. Today, while affecting millions of men and boys worldwide, MGS receives insufficient attention, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). To provide a systematic review with an epidemiological update of MGS, we inspected both online and hardcopy resources in our appraisal. A total of 147 articles were eventually identified, only 31 articles were exclusively focused on MGS with original or targeted research. From these, we discuss pertinent clinico-pathological features of MGS, highlight the possible connection and interplay with HIV, and assess current diagnostic techniques alongside consideration of their use and application in SSA. To appreciate the burden of MGS more fully, especially in endemic areas, there is a clear need for better surveillance and longitudinal population research to investigate the best point-of-care (POC) diagnostic and its performance through time. Furthermore, to optimise individual case management, exploration of alternative praziquantel dosing regimens is needed for MGS in men with or without HIV co-infection.

  CSV Title: Truth-telling and the regulator. Experimental evidence from commercial fishermen
  CSV Abstract: Understanding what determines the truth-telling of economic agents towards their regulator is of major economic importance from banking to the management of common-pool resources such as European fisheries. By enacting a discard-ban on unwanted fish-catches without increasing monitoring activities, the European Union (EU) depends on fishermen's truth-telling. Using a coin-tossing task in an artefactual mail field experiment with 120 German commercial fishermen, we test whether truth-telling in a baseline setting differs from behavior in two treatments that exploit fishermen's widespread ill-regard of their regulator, the EU. We find, first, that fishermen misreport coin tosses more strongly to their advantage in a treatment where they are faced with the EU flag, and, second, that misreporting is consistent with behavior in other hidden tasks. We also find some supportive evidence for our first result in a conceptual replication with 1200 UK citizens who voted ‘leave’ in the Brexit referendum. Our findings imply that lying is more extensive towards an ill-regarded regulator and that policy needs to account for this endogenously eroding honesty base.

  CSV Title: Intravascular Mesenchymal Stromal/Stem Cell Therapy Product Diversification: Time for New Clinical Guidelines
  CSV Abstract: Intravascular infusion is the most popular route for therapeutic multipotent mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (MSC) delivery in hundreds of clinical trials. Meta-analysis has demonstrated that bone marrow MSC infusion is safe. It is not clear if this also applies to diverse new cell products derived from other sources, such as adipose and perinatal tissues. Different MSC products display varying levels of highly procoagulant tissue factor (TF) and may adversely trigger the instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR). Suitable strategies for assessing and controlling hemocompatibility and optimized cell delivery are crucial for the development of safer and more effective MSC therapies.

  CSV Title: Creep strain measurement using a potential drop technique
  CSV Abstract: This paper will demonstrate the use of a potential drop sensor to monitor strain. In particular, the suitability of the technique to high temperature or harsh environment applications presents an opportunity for monitoring strain in components operating under creep conditions. Monitoring creep damage in power station components is a long standing technological challenge to the non-destructive evaluation community. It is well established in the literature that strain rate serves as an excellent indicator of the progress of creep damage and can be used for remnant life calculations. To facilitate the use of such strain rate based evaluation methods, a permanently installed, strain sensitive, potential drop technique has been developed. The technique has very simple and robust hardware lending itself to use at high temperatures or in harsh environments. Strain inversions are presented and demonstrated experimentally; a room temperature, plastic deformation experiment is used for validation and additionally an accelerated creep test demonstrates operation at high temperature (600 °C+). Excellent agreement is shown between potential drop inverted strain and control measurements.

  CSV Title: Data on clinical significance of GAS2 in colorectal cancer cells
  CSV Abstract: The growth arrest-specific 2 (GAS2) was cloned and found to be upregulated in the feces of recurrent CRC patients. This overexpressed GAS2 induced different patterns of gene expressions in CRC cells. Briefly, one cell proliferation marker, Ki-67 antigen (Ki-67), was upregulated in the cells with overexpressed GAS2, "Correlation between proliferation markers: PCNA, Ki-67, MCM-2 and antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 in colorectal cancer" [1]. Whereas, the expression of another cell proliferation marker, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), changed insignificantly [1]. In addition, the mRNA level of one cyclin involving in both cell cycle G1/S and G2/M transitions was also not affected by GAS2 overexpression, "Cdc20 and Cks direct the spindle checkpoint-independent destruction of cyclin A" [2]. The experimental design and procedures in this article can be helpful for understanding the molecular significance of GAS2 in SW480 and SW620 CRC cells.

  CSV Title: Laser-stimulated birefringence of Ga2O3-La2S2.95Se0.05 glasses for optical recording of information
  CSV Abstract: We show an opportunity to change the birefringence of Ga2O3 – La2S2.95Se0.05 glasses doped by Er3+ and La3+ ions at λ = 1150 nm wavelength of cw He-Ne laser under illumination of the femtosecond laser. The variation of the refractive indices was found during illumination by 180 fs laser with frequency about 65 MHz (at wavelength λ = 1045 nm). The laser-stimulated birefringence has been explored versus temperature. The observed laser induced and temperature dependences of the birefringence confirm a huge contribution of anharmonic phonon subsystems which is typical for chalcogenide glasses. Due to an occurrence of local space charge density asymmetry, the efficiency of birefringence is enhanced. The anisotropy effect exists only during the illumination and is diminished during 10…12 s after switching off of the photo-inducing laser treatment. There is observed also a correlation between the occurred grating patterns and the values of the birefringence.

  CSV Title: Are patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who are identified through active case finding in the community different than those identified in healthcare facilities?
  CSV Abstract: The lack of healthcare access contributes to large numbers of tuberculosis (TB) cases being missed and has led to renewed interest in outreach approaches to increase detection. It is however unclear whether outreach activities increase case detection or merely identify patients before they attend health facilities. We compared adults with cough of >2 weeks' duration recruited in health facilities (1202 participants) or in urban slums (2828 participants) in Nigeria. Participants provided demographic and clinical information and were screened using smear microscopy. The characteristics of smear-positive and smear-negative individuals were compared stratified by place of enrolment. Two hundred nine health facility participants (17.4%) and 485 community-based participants (16.9%) were smear positive for pulmonary TB. Community-based smear-positive cases were older (mean age, 36.3 vs. 31.8 years), had longer cough duration (10.3 vs. 6.8 weeks) and longer duration of weight loss (4.6 vs. 3.6 weeks) than facility-based cases; and they complained more of fever (87.4% vs. 74.6%), chest pain (89.0% vs. 67.0%) and anorexia (79.5% vs. 55.5%). Community smear-negative participants were older (mean, 39.4 vs. 34.0 years), were more likely to have symptoms and were more likely to have symptoms of longer duration than smear-negative facility-based participants. Patients with pulmonary TB identified in the community had more symptoms and longer duration of illness than facility-based patients, which appeared to be due to factors differentially affecting access to healthcare. Community-based activities targeted at urban slum populations may identify a different TB case population than that accessing stationary services.

  CSV Title: Environmental regulation in transition: Policy officials’ views of regulatory instruments and their mapping to environmental risks
  CSV Abstract: This study re-analysed 14 semi-structured interviews with policy officials from the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to explore the use of a variety of regulatory instruments and different levels of risk across 14 policy domains and 18 separately named risks. Interviews took place within a policy environment of a better regulation agenda and of broader regulatory reform. Of 619 (n) coded references to 5 categories of regulatory instrument, ‘command and control’ regulation (n = 257) and support mechanisms (n = 118) dominated the discussions, with a preference for ‘command and control’ cited in 8 of the policy domains. A framing analysis revealed officials’ views on instrument effectiveness, including for sub-categories of the 5 key instruments. Views were mixed, though notably positive for economic instruments including taxation, fiscal instruments and information provision. An overlap analysis explored officials’ mapping of public environmental risks to instrument types suited to their management. While officials frequently cite risk concepts generally within discussions, the extent of overlap for risks of specific significance was low across all risks. Only ‘command and control’ was mapped to risks of moderate significance in likelihood and impact severity. These results show that policy makers still prefer ‘command and control’ approaches when a certainty of outcome is sought and that alternative means are sought for lower risk situations. The detailed reasons for selection, including the mapping of certain instruments to specific risk characteristics, is still developing.

  CSV Title: Spectral sensitivity of guppy visual pigments reconstituted in vitro to resolve association of opsins with cone cell types
  CSV Abstract: The guppy (Poecilia reticulata) shows remarkable variation of photoreceptor cells in the retina, especially those sensitive to middle-to-long wavelengths of light. Microspectrophotometry (MSP) has revealed varying “green”, “green-yellow” and “yellow” cone cells among guppies in Trinidad and Venezuela (Cumana). In the guppy genome, there are four “long-wave” opsin loci (LWS-1, -2, -3 and -4). Two LWS-1 alleles have potentially differing spectral sensitivity (LWS-1/180Ser and LWS-1/180Ala). In addition, two “middle-wave” loci (RH2-1 and -2), two “short-wave” loci (SWS2-A and -B), and a single “ultraviolet” locus (SWS1) as well as a single “rhodopsin” locus (RH1) are present. However, the absorption spectra of these photopigments have not been measured directly and the association of cell types with these opsins remains speculative. In the present study, we reconstituted these opsin photopigments in vitro. The wavelengths of maximal absorbance (λmax) were 571 nm (LWS-1/180Ser), 562 nm (LWS-1/180Ala), 519 nm (LWS-3), 516 nm (LWS-2), 516 nm (RH2-1), 476 nm (RH2-2), 438 nm (SWS2-A), 408 nm (SWS2-B), 353 nm (SWS1) and 503 nm (RH1). The λmax of LWS-3 is much shorter than the value expected (560 nm) from the “five-sites” rule. The two LWS-1 alleles could explain difference of the reported MSP λmax values for the yellow cone class between Trinidad and Cumana guppies. Absence of the short-wave-shifted LWS-3 and the green-yellow cone in the green swordtail supports the hypothesis that this cell class of the guppy co-expresses the LWS-1 and LWS-3. These results reveal the basis of variability in the guppy visual system and provide insight into the behavior and ecology of these tropical fishes.

  CSV Title: Single-Cell ID-seq Reveals Dynamic BMP Pathway Activation Upstream of the MAF/MAFB-Program in Epidermal Differentiation
  CSV Abstract: Epidermal homeostasis requires balanced and coordinated adult stem cell renewal and differentiation. These processes are controlled by both extracellular signaling and by cell intrinsic transcription regulatory networks, yet how these control mechanisms are integrated to achieve this is unclear. Here, we developed single-cell Immuno-Detection by sequencing (scID-seq)and simultaneously measured 69 proteins (including 34 phosphorylated epitopes)at single-cell resolution to study the activation state of signaling pathways during human epidermal differentiation. Computational pseudo-timing inference revealed dynamic activation of the JAK-STAT, WNT, and BMP pathways along the epidermal differentiation trajectory. We found that during differentiation, cells start producing BMP2-ligands and activate the canonical intracellular effectors SMAD1/5/9. Mechanistically, the BMP pathway is responsible for activating the MAF/MAFB/ZNF750 transcription factor network to drive late-stage epidermal differentiation. Our work indicates that incorporating signaling pathway activation into this transcription regulatory network enables coordination of transcription programs during epidermal differentiation.

  CSV Title: Development and validation of Raman spectroscopic classification models to discriminate tongue squamous cell carcinoma from non-tumorous tissue
  CSV Abstract: Background Currently, up to 85% of the oral resection specimens have inadequate resection margins, of which the majority is located in the deeper soft tissue layers. The prognosis of patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) of the tongue is negatively affected by these inadequate surgical resections. Raman spectroscopy, an optical technique, can potentially be used for intra-operative evaluation of resection margins. Objective To develop in vitro Raman spectroscopy-based tissue classification models that discriminate OCSCC of the tongue from (subepithelial) non-tumorous tissue. Materials and methods Tissue classification models were developed using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) followed by (hierarchical) Linear Discriminant Analysis ((h)LDA). The models were based on a training set of 720 histopathologically annotated Raman spectra, obtained from 25 tongue samples (11 OCSCC and 14 normal) of 10 patients, and were validated by means of an independent validation set of 367 spectra, obtained from 19 tongue samples (6 OCSCC and 13 normal) of 11 patients. Results A PCA-LDA tissue classification model ‘tumor’ versus ‘non-tumorous tissue’ (i.e. surface squamous epithelium, connective tissue, muscle, adipose tissue, gland and nerve) showed an accuracy of 86% (sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 66%). A two-step PCA-hLDA tissue classification model ‘tumor’ versus ‘non-tumorous tissue’ showed an accuracy of 91% (sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 78%). Conclusion An accurate PCA-hLDA Raman spectroscopy-based tissue classification model for discrimination between OCSCC and (especially the subepithelial) non-tumorous tongue tissue was developed and validated. This model with high sensitivity and specificity may prove to be very helpful to detect tumor in the resection margins.

  CSV Title: Investigating the particle to fibre transition threshold during electrohydrodynamic atomization of a polymer solution
  CSV Abstract: Electrohydrodynamic atomization (EHDA) is a key research area for producing micro and nano-sized structures. This process can be categorized into two main operating regimes: electrospraying for particle generation and electrospinning for fibre production. Producing particles/fibres of the desired size or morphology depends on two main factors; properties of the polymeric solution used and the processing conditions including flow rate, applied voltage and collection distance. In this work the particle-fibre transition region was analyzed by changing the polymer concentration of PLGA poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) in acetone between 2 and 25 wt%. Subsequently the processing conditions were adjusted to study the optimum transition parameters. Additionally the EHDA configuration was also modified by adding a metallic plate to observe the deposition area. The diameter and the distance of the plate from the capillary tip were adjusted to investigate variations in particle and fibre morphologies as well. It was found that complete transition from particles to fibres occurs at 20 wt% indicating concentration to be the dominant criterion. Low flow rates yielded fibres without beads. However the applied voltage and distance between the tip of the nozzle jetting the polymer solution and collector (working distance) did not yield definitive results. Reducing the collector distance and increasing applied voltages produces smooth as well as beaded fibres. Addition of a metal plate reduces particle size by ∼ 1 μm; the fibre size increases especially with increasing plate diameter while bead density and size reduces when the disc is fixed closer to the capillary tip. Additionally, the deposition area is reduced by 70% and 57% with the addition of metal plates of 30 mm and 60 mm, respectively. The results indicate that a metal plate can be utilized further to tune the particle/fibre size and morphology and this also significantly increases the yield of EHDA process which is currently a limitation in adopting it as a mass production technique.

  CSV Title: Full-length genome characterization and quasispecies distribution of hepatitis A virus isolates in China
  CSV Abstract: Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis and has significant implications to public health worldwide. To characterize HAV strains circulating in China, five samples collected in different provinces from 2006-2009 were entirely sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis based on distinct segments showed that all five sequences belonged to subgenotype IA, but with slight differences in some fragments. No amino acid mutations were found at the known neutralizing epitope sites, and one unique substitution was identified near the immunodominant site. While no intertypic recombination was detected, intratypic recombination signals were found in the study. Molecular evolution analyses showed that the estimated mean substitution rate of genotype I worldwide was 3.27×10-4 substitutions/site/year, and the time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) was about 267years ago. The quasispecies distribution across the complete genome was also evaluated, and the high mutation frequency regions were mainly at the nonstructural protein coding sequences. This study contributed information on the genotype distribution, selection pressure, neutralizing epitope site mutations, recombination events and quasispecies distribution of HAV strains in China. The evolutionary status of genotype I worldwide was also analyzed, which will provide a reference for future HAV molecular epidemiology studies.

  CSV Title: Brain imaging genetics in ADHD and beyond – Mapping pathways from gene to disorder at different levels of complexity
  CSV Abstract: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common and often persistent neurodevelopmental disorder. Beyond gene-finding, neurobiological parameters, such as brain structure, connectivity, and function, have been used to link genetic variation to ADHD symptomatology. We performed a systematic review of brain imaging genetics studies involving 62 ADHD candidate genes in childhood and adult ADHD cohorts. Fifty-one eligible research articles described studies of 13 ADHD candidate genes. Almost exclusively, single genetic variants were studied, mostly focussing on dopamine-related genes. While promising results have been reported, imaging genetics studies are thus far hampered by methodological differences in study design and analysis methodology, as well as limited sample sizes. Beyond reviewing imaging genetics studies, we also discuss the need for complementary approaches at multiple levels of biological complexity and emphasize the importance of combining and integrating findings across levels for a better understanding of biological pathways from gene to disease. These may include multi-modal imaging genetics studies, bioinformatic analyses, and functional analyses of cell and animal models.

  CSV Title: GABA predicts visual intelligence
  CSV Abstract: Early psychological researchers proposed a link between intelligence and low-level perceptual performance. It was recently suggested that this link is driven by individual variations in the ability to suppress irrelevant information, evidenced by the observation of strong correlations between perceptual surround suppression and cognitive performance. However, the neural mechanisms underlying such a link remain unclear. A candidate mechanism is neural inhibition by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), but direct experimental support for GABA-mediated inhibition underlying suppression is inconsistent. Here we report evidence consistent with a global suppressive mechanism involving GABA underlying the link between sensory performance and intelligence. We measured visual cortical GABA concentration, visuo-spatial intelligence and visual surround suppression in a group of healthy adults. Levels of GABA were strongly predictive of both intelligence and surround suppression, with higher levels of intelligence associated with higher levels of GABA and stronger surround suppression. These results indicate that GABA-mediated neural inhibition may be a key factor determining cognitive performance and suggests a physiological mechanism linking surround suppression and intelligence.

  CSV Title: Use of β3-methionine as an amino acid substrate of Escherichia coli methionyl-tRNA synthetase
  CSV Abstract: Polypeptides containing β-amino acids are attractive tools for the design of novel proteins having unique properties of medical or industrial interest. Incorporation of β-amino acids in vivo requires the development of efficient aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases specific of these non-canonical amino acids. Here, we have performed a detailed structural and biochemical study of the recognition and use of β3-Met by Escherichia coli methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS). We show that MetRS binds β3-Met with a 24-fold lower affinity but catalyzes the esterification of the non-canonical amino acid onto tRNA with a rate lowered by three orders of magnitude. Accurate measurements of the catalytic parameters required careful consideration of the presence of contaminating α-Met in β3-Met commercial samples. The 1.45 Å crystal structure of the MetRS: β3-Met complex shows that β3-Met binds the enzyme essentially like α-Met, but the carboxylate moiety is mobile and not adequately positioned to react with ATP for aminoacyl adenylate formation. This study provides structural and biochemical bases for engineering MetRS with improved β3-Met aminoacylation capabilities.

  CSV Title: Enhanced error-related brain activations for mistakes that harm others: ERP evidence from a novel social performance-monitoring paradigm
  CSV Abstract: Our mistakes often have negative consequences for ourselves, but may also harm the people around us. Continuous monitoring of our performance is therefore crucial for both our own and others’ well-being. Here, we investigated how modulations in responsibility for other's harm affects electrophysiological correlates of performance-monitoring, viz. the error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe). Healthy participants (N = 27) performed a novel social performance-monitoring paradigm in two responsibility contexts. Mistakes made in the harmful context resulted in a negative consequence for a co-actor, i.e., hearing a loud aversive sound, while errors in the non-harmful context were followed by a soft non-aversive sound. Although participants themselves did not receive auditory feedback in either context, they did experience harmful mistakes as more distressing and reported higher effort to perform well in the harmful context. ERN amplitudes were enhanced for harmful compared to non-harmful mistakes. Pe amplitudes were unaffected. The present study shows that performing in a potentially harmful social context amplifies early automatic performance-monitoring processes and increases the impact of the resulting harmful mistakes. These outcomes not only further our theoretical knowledge of social performance monitoring, but also demonstrate a novel and useful paradigm to investigate aberrant responsibility attitudes in various clinical populations.

  CSV Title: Reduced respiratory motion artefact in constant TR multi-slice MRI of the mouse
  CSV Abstract: Purpose: Multi-slice scanning in the abdomen and thorax of small animals is compromised by the effects of respiration unless imaging and respiration are synchronised. To avoid the signal modulations that result from respiration motion and a variable TR, blocks of fully relaxed slices are typically acquired during inter-breath periods, at the cost of scan efficiency. This paper reports a conceptually simple yet effective prospective gating acquisition mode for multi-slice scanning in free breathing small animals at any fixed TR of choice with reduced sensitivity to respiratory motion. Methods: Multi-slice scan modes have been implemented in which each slice has its own specific projection or phase encode loop index counter. When a breath is registered RF pulses continue to be applied but data are not acquired, and the corresponding counters remain fixed so that the data are acquired one TR later, providing it coincides with an inter-breath period. The approach is refined to reacquire the slice data that are acquired immediately before each breath is detected. Only the data with reduced motion artefact are used in image reconstruction. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated in the RARE scan mode which is well known to be particularly useful for tumour visualization. Results: Validation in mice with RARE demonstrates improved stability with respect to ungated scanning where signal averaging is often used to reduce artefacts. SNR enhancement maps demonstrate the improved efficiency of the proposed method that is equivalent to at least a 2.5 fold reduction in scan time with respect to ungated signal averaging. A steady-state magnetisation transfer contrast prepared gradient echo implementation is observed to highlight tumour structure. Supplementary simulations demonstrate that only small variations in respiration rate are required to enable efficient sampling with the proposed method. Conclusions: The proposed prospective gating acquisition scheme enables efficient multi-slice scanning in small animals at the optimum TR with reduced sensitivity to respiratory motion. The method is compatible with a wide range of complementary methods including non-Cartesian scan modes, partially parallel imaging, and compressed sensing. In particular, the proposed scheme reduces the need for continual close monitoring to effect operator intervention in response to respiratory rate changes, which is both difficult to maintain and precludes high throughput.

  CSV Title: Absence of neural speech discrimination in preterm infants at term-equivalent age
  CSV Abstract: Children born preterm are at higher risk to develop language deficits. Auditory speech discrimination deficits may be early signs for language developmental problems. The present study used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to investigate neural speech discrimination in 15 preterm infants at term-equivalent age compared to 15 full term neonates. The full term group revealed a significantly greater hemodynamic response to forward compared to backward speech within the left hemisphere extending from superior temporal to inferior parietal and middle and inferior frontal areas. In contrast, the preterm group did not show differences in their hemodynamic responses during forward versus backward speech, thus, they did not discriminate speech from non-speech. Groups differed significantly in their responses to forward speech, whereas they did not differ in their responses to backward speech.

  CSV Title: Mzansi's mountain hemlocks: The identities of Hilliard and Burtt's Conium species 3 and 4 (Apiaceae) and a revised key for the genus in sub-Saharan Africa
  CSV Abstract: Southern Africa is the centre of diversity for the Apiaceae genus Conium L., notorious for the execution of Socrates. The recent expansion of Conium herbarium material from the southern Great Escarpment (Roggeveldberge to the Stormberg, South Africa) has allowed us to assess the taxonomic status of the two taxa (Conium species 3 and 4) for which, at the time of the last treatment of the genus in southern Africa by O.M. Hilliard and B.L. Burtt, there was insufficient material to formally recognise them. We consider only Conium sp. 4 to be sufficiently distinct to warrant formal recognition, and describe it here as the Cape Midlands Escarpment endemic C. hilliburttorum Magee and V.R. Clark. As a cliff-base specialist vulnerable to competition from several alien invasive species, and potentially climate change, we recommend a conservation status of Vulnerable. For the second taxon, Conium sp. 3, the shape and degree of fusion of the involucel bracts is more variable than originally thought. We therefore consider it to be conspecific with the eastern Great Escarpment species C. fontanum Hilliard and B.L. Burtt, expanding the range westwards onto the Sneeuberg. We also present collections of C. sphaerocarpum from the Nuweveldberge, effectively also expanding the known distribution of this winter-rainfall species slightly eastwards. A revised key to the now five species of Conium recognised in sub-Saharan Africa (including the introduced C. maculatum) is provided.

  CSV Title: Whole body effective dose equivalent dataset for MAX and FAX shielded with Common Aerospace Materials in deep space
  CSV Abstract: Materials have a primary purpose in the design of space vehicles, such as fuels, walls, racks, windows, etc. Additionally, each will also affect space radiation protection. Using the On-Line Tool for the Assessment of Radiation in Space (OLTARIS), version 3.5, analysis package, this article includes the whole body effective dose equivalent (ED) data from human phantoms being shielded by 59 aerospace materials for deep space travel. To represent the average anatomy of an astronaut, the Female Adult voXel (FAX), 2005 version, and the Male Adult voXel (MAX), 2005 version, human phantoms are used. A simple spherical geometry, which is composed of a spherical shell with the human phantom placed in the center, is also used. Eighteen shielding thicknesses ranging from 0.01 to 1000 g per centimetres squared are evaluated and the ray distribution used in this study is the 1002 geodesic. All aerospace materials are categorized into four groups: metals, polymers, composites, and fuels, hydrides, and liquid gases. These materials include common fuels and propellants used in space travel, engineered materials developed to significantly increase the absorption of secondary radiation, and materials in the early stages of development for the purpose of meeting both shielding and structural needs of future spacecraft missions. The data in this article is used for the paper, “Evaluating the Effectiveness of Common Aerospace Materials at Lowering the Whole Body Effective Dose Equivalent in Deep Space,” [13].

  CSV Title: Stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of water vapor in volcanic plumes sampled in glass bottles using cavity ring-down spectroscopy
  CSV Abstract: The isotopic compositions (δ2H and δ18O) of fumarolic H2O emitted during volcanic eruptions can distinguish the type of eruption (magmatic or phreatic), but direct sampling of fumarolic H2O in eruptive volcanoes is often neither practical nor safe. In this study, we developed a new analytical system to safely determine the isotopic compositions of fumarolic H2O from the volcanic plume samples taken in glass bottles. The system consisted of stainless steel gas introduction line and a cavity ring-down spectroscopic unit. In the 1 L glass sample bottles, analytical precision (1σ) was estimated to be better than 2‰ and 0.3‰, respectively, when >3400 ppmv of H2O was introduced, and better than 3‰ (δ2H) and 0.4‰ (δ18O) when >1800 ppmv of H2O was introduced. The H2O concentration accuracy was better than 5%. Using this in-situ collection method and the analytical system, we determined the isotopic compositions of H2O in volcanic plume samples taken at Iwo-yama in the Kirishima volcano group (Japan), and deduced the isotopic composition of fumarolic H2O from the volcanic plume. The reciprocal of the H2O concentration in the plume samples showed a good linear relationship with the isotopic composition. The isotopic composition of fumarolic H2O from Iwo-yama estimated from the plume samples directly corresponded to the determined fumarolic H2O. This method improves upon previous analyses to obtain the isotopic compositions of fumarolic H2O, particularly by reducing tedious, time consuming, and dangerous sampling of water vapor at volcanic fumaroles.

  CSV Title: Implementing CRISPR-Cas technologies in conventional and non-conventional yeasts: Current state and future prospects
  CSV Abstract: Within five years, the CRISPR-Cas system has emerged as the dominating tool for genome engineering, while also changing the speed and efficiency of metabolic engineering in conventional (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe) and non-conventional (Yarrowia lipolytica, Pichia pastoris syn. Komagataella phaffii, Kluyveromyces lactis, Candida albicans and C. glabrata) yeasts. Especially in S. cerevisiae, an extensive toolbox of advanced CRISPR-related applications has been established, including crisprTFs and gene drives. The comparison of innovative CRISPR-Cas expression strategies in yeasts presented here may also serve as guideline to implement and refine CRISPR-Cas systems for highly efficient genome editing in other eukaryotic organisms.

  CSV Title: Peritoneal tunnels: A site at risk for treatment failure when performing treatments for peritoneal metastases. A case series of 2 patients
  CSV Abstract: Background: Peritoneal metastases from gastrointestinal cancer can be treated by a combination of surgery to remove visible evidence of disease and perioperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy to eradicate microscopic disease. Complete cytoreduction is necessary for long-term benefit. Methods: Two sites for incomplete cytoreduction because tumor is hidden from visual inspection were identified. Patients who developed recurrence at these anatomic sites were studied. Results: A peritoneal tunnel along a patent processus vaginalis allowed tumor to be sequestered along the inguinal canal in a female patient. A peritoneal tunnel beneath a hepatic bridge over the round ligament obscured mucinous tumor in a male patient. Conclusions: Peritoneal tunnels in the inguinal region or at the porta hepatis should be opened by surgical dissection so that all foci of peritoneal metastases are removed at a complete cytoreductive surgery and these sites treated with chemotherapy.

  CSV Title: Long-term effects of hydromorphological stream restoration on changes in microhabitats of Ephemera danica (Ephemeroptera) and its population
  CSV Abstract: Relationships between various techniques of stream restoration and selected characteristics of larvae of Ephemera danica (Müller 1764), were investigated along a small lowland watercourse, the Kwacza (N Poland). Effects of stream restoration were assessed on the basis of abundance, biomass, and body length of mayfly larvae as well as their biological condition (i.e. relation of mean body weight and length) within a decade (2007–2017) at each of 10 various hydrotechnical constructions along a 2.5-km stretch of the watercourse. Our results show that hydromorphological changes in the stream bed were strong stress factors for the mayfly population, especially in the first year of monitoring. In the following years, the applied restoration techniques created windows of opportunity for the population of E. danica which were successfully used by this species, as it increased in abundance and body length and colonized the whole restored stretch of the stream. Finally, 10 years after the river bed transformation, mayfly density increased 4-fold, while larval body length and biomass increased about 40-fold, as compared with the pre-restoration period. The improved habitat conditions of E. danica were observed in the sections where stream banks were strengthened with tree trunks, double groynes, and double semi-palisades to protect the banks against erosion. Surprisingly, the highest increase in larval abundance was recorded in a by-pass zone, an isolated part of the stream bed, which played the role of a refuge. Using redundancy analysis (RDA), we found that the mayfly population development after the stream restoration was primarily due to modified water velocities in the transformed sections and changes in water quality (e.g. higher pH, lower concentrations of N-NO3−). We inferred that the modification of the stream bed has contributed to favourable changes in the studied mayfly population, which constitutes an important food base for the fish fauna.

  CSV Title: Comprehensive review of current natural gas liquefaction processes on technical and economic performance
  CSV Abstract: This paper provides a quantitative technical and economic overview of the status of natural-gas liquefaction (LNG) processes. Data is based on industrial practices in technical reports and optimization results in academic literature, which are harmonized to primary energy input and production cost. The LNG processes reviewed are classified into three categories: onshore large-scale, onshore small-scale and offshore. These categories each have a different optimization focus in academic literature. Besides minimizing energy consumption, the focus is also on: coproduction for large-scale; simplicity and ease of operation for small-scale; and low space requirement, safety and insensitivity to motion for offshore. The review on academic literature also indicated that optimization for lowest energy consumption may not lead to the lowest production cost. The review on technical reports shows that the mixed-refrigerant process dominates the LNG industry, but has competitions from the cascade process in large-scale applications and from the expander-based process in small-scale and offshore applications. This study also found that there is a potential improvement in adopting new optimization algorithms for efficiently solving complex optimization problems. The technical performance overview shows that the primary energy input for large-scale processes (0.031–0.102 GJ/GJ LNG) is lower than for small-scale processes (0.049–0.362 GJ/GJ LNG). However, the primary energy input for identical processes do not necessarily decrease with increasing capacity and the performance of major equipment shows low correlation with scale. The economic performance overview shows specific capital costs varying significantly from 124 to 2255 $/TPA LNG. The variation could be, among others, caused by the different complexities of the facility and different local circumstances. Production cost, excluding feed costs, varies between 0.69 and 4.10 $/GJ LNG, with capital costs being the dominant contributor. The feed cost itself could be 1.51–4.01 $/GJ LNG, depending on the location. Lastly, the quantitative harmonization results on technical and economic performance in this study can function as a baseline for the purpose of comparison.

  CSV Title: Structure of the Helicase Domain of DNA Polymerase Theta Reveals a Possible Role in the Microhomology-Mediated End-Joining Pathway
  CSV Abstract: Summary DNA polymerase theta (Polθ) has been identified as a crucial alternative non-homologous end-joining factor in mammalian cells. Polθ is upregulated in a range of cancer cell types defective in homologous recombination, and knockdown has been shown to inhibit cell survival in a subset of these, making it an attractive target for cancer treatment. We present crystal structures of the helicase domain of human Polθ in the presence and absence of bound nucleotides, and a characterization of its DNA-binding and DNA-stimulated ATPase activities. Comparisons with related helicases from the Hel308 family identify several unique features. Polθ exists as a tetramer both in the crystals and in solution. We propose a model for DNA binding to the Polθ helicase domain in the context of the Polθ tetramer, which suggests a role for the helicase domain in strand annealing of DNA templates for subsequent processing by the polymerase domain.

  CSV Title: The cooperative sex: Sexual interactions among female bonobos are linked to increases in oxytocin, proximity and coalitions
  CSV Abstract: In some species habitual same-sex sexual behavior co-occurs with high levels of intra-sexual alliance formation, suggesting that these behaviors may be linked. We tested for such a link by comparing behavioral and physiological outcomes of sex with unrelated same- and opposite-sex partners in female bonobos (Pan paniscus). We analyzed behavioral outcomes following 971 sexual events involving n = 19 female and n = 8 male adult and sub-adult members of a wild, habituated bonobo community. We additionally collected n = 143 urine samples before and after sexual interactions to non-invasively measure oxytocin (OT), which modulates female sexual behavior and facilitates cooperation in other species. The majority of sexual events (65%) consisted of female same-sex genito-genital rubbing (or GG-rubbing). Female dyads engaged in significantly more sexual interactions than did inter-sexual dyads, and females were more likely to remain within close proximity to their partners following GG-rubbing. Females also exhibited greater increases in urinary OT following GG-rubbing compared with copulations, indicating a physiological basis for increased motivation to cooperate among females. The frequency of coalitionary support among non-kin was positively predicted by the frequency of sexual interactions for female as well opposite-sex dyads, although coalitionary support tended to be more frequent among females. The emergence of habitual same-sex sexual behavior may have been an important step in the evolution of cooperation outside of kinship and pair-bonds in one of our closest phylogenetic relatives.

  CSV Title: A model to study the inhibition of nsP2B-nsP3 protease of dengue virus with imidazole, oxazole, triazole thiadiazole, and thiazolidine based scaffolds
  CSV Abstract: A theoretical model was developed to allosterically inhibit the biological activity of dengue virus (DENV) by targeting the non-structural protein ns2B-nsP3 protease based on the in silico studies. The imidazole, oxazole, triazole, thiadiazole, and thiazolidine based scaffolds were imported from the ZINC database, reported by various research group with different biological activity. They were found biologically active as they contain heterocyclic fragments. Generic evolutionary based molecular docking was performed to screen the highly potent molecule. The docking results show that the molecule having ZINC ID-633972 is best inhibitor. Further, the bioavailability and other physiochemical parameters were also calculated for the top four molecule. The highly potent molecule was further refined by the density functional theory and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation. The MD analysis coroborate the successful docking of the molecule in the binding cavity of nsP2B-nsP3 protease of DENV. The Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area approach was also applied and result coroborate the docking and MD result.

  CSV Title: Energy neutrality versus carbon footprint minimization in municipal wastewater treatment plants
  CSV Abstract: This work aimed to compare the carbon footprint (CF) of six full-scale wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The CF was estimated in the range of 23–100 kg CO2e per population equivalent. In the total CF, the direct emissions held the highest share (62–74%) for the plants with energy recovery from biogas. In the plants depending entirely on the power grid, the indirect emissions due to energy consumption dominated the total CF (69–72%). The estimated CF was found highly sensitive towards the choice of N2O emission factors. A dual effect of external substrates co-digestion on the CF has been presented. After co-digestion, the overall CF decreased by 7% while increasing the biogas production by 17%. While applying the empirical model, the level of energy neutrality was strongly related to the ratio of the indirect to direct emissions.

  CSV Title: Promoting preschoolers' numerical knowledge through spatial analogies: Numbers’ spatial alignment influences its learning
  CSV Abstract: The development of early numerical representations is a complex cognitive process whereby children acquire numerical competences. To establish whether analogy making plays a role in this process of learning, we devised a classroom game based on an analysis of a number-line analogy that leverages children' spatial intuitions for helping them understand the numbers. To investigate the role of spatial positioning along the number line, seventy-seven preschoolers were randomly assigned to control tasks (control condition) or to embodied number line tasks in two possible spatial locations: watching numbers increasing either from left to right (space-number alignment condition) or from right to left (space-number misalignment condition). Performing learning activities for roughly two hours promoted children's proficiency in four tasks of numerical knowledge, but only children under spatial and numerical alignment increased their proficiency in a task of number line estimation. This finding shows that the numerical representations generated by children during training were integrated with spatial information that was implicit in the learning activities, thus revealing that analogical alignments play a key role in the formation of early numerical representations. Additionally, this study illustrates that interrogating the analogy at the foundation of an instructional activity highlights key instructional decisions that can have a large impact on learning. Future research along this line might provide a framework for using analogy at the foundations of instructional design.

  CSV Title: Comprehensive and quantitative profiling of B vitamins and related compounds in the mammalian liver
  CSV Abstract: A method for the simultaneous quantification of B vitamins and related amines in one-carbon (1C) metabolism would benefit the study of diet and genetic/epigenetic regulation of mammalian development and health. We present a validated method for the simultaneous quantitative analysis of 13 B vitamers and four related 1C-pathway amine intermediates in liver using hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Frozen sheep liver samples (50 mg) were homogenized in cold 50% acetonitrile containing 1% acetic acid with the addition of two isotope labelled internal standards. Hot acid hydrolysis was applied to release the protein-bound forms. The separation of 17 analytes was achieved using a pHILIC column with a total run time of 13 min. Detection was achieved in electrospray positive ionisation mode. Limits of detection for the majority of analytes were within the range of 0.4–3.2 pmol/g. The method was applied to 266 sheep liver samples and revealed that adenosylcobalamin, methylcobalamin, pyridoxic acid, flavin adenine dinucleotide and thiamine were the major forms of the B vitamers present with pyridoxal 5′-phosphate and thiamine pyrophosphate being detected at lower concentrations. Trimethylglycine and methylglycine were the predominant 1C-related amines measured. As anticipated, the B vitamin status of individuals varied considerably, reflecting dietary and genetic variation in our chosen outbred model species. This method offers a simple sample extraction procedure and provides comprehensive coverage of B vitamins coupled with good sensitivity and reliability.

  CSV Title: Immunogenic proteins and their vaccine development potential evaluation in outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of Flavobacterium columnare
  CSV Abstract: Flavobacterium columnare is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes columnaris disease in freshwater fish worldwide. Many studies have focused on the identification of protective antigens to aid in the development of novel vaccines against the disease. In this study, an immunoblotting approach was employed to identify immunogenic outer membrane proteins (OMPs) from F. columnare in two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) map gels using antibacterial sera obtained from grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), and anti-grass carp-recombinant Ig (rIg) monoclonal antibodies. Five unique immunogenic proteins, including the gliding motility lipoprotein GldJ (GldJ), hypothetical protein FCOL_13420 (Fco1), lipoprotein (Lip), F0F1 ATP synthase subunit beta (F0f1) and outer membrane efflux protein precursor (Omep), were characterized. Over-expression of these proteins in Escherichia coli DE3, and their immunogenicity and protective efficacy were evaluated in grass carp. The relative percent survival (RPS) of the groups immunized separately with recombinant GldJ, Lip and Omep was 72%, 64% and 68%, respectively when compared to control fish. Up-regulation of immuno-related genes and specific antibodies were detected in immunized fish and sera of immunized fish inhibited the growth of F. columnare. The results suggest that GldJ, Lip and Omep are major protective antigens and may be considered as novel candidates in the development of vaccines against columnaris disease in fish.

  CSV Title: A Ralstonia solanacearum phage ϕRP15 is closely related to Viunalikeviruses and encodes 19 tRNA-related sequences
  CSV Abstract: A T4-related phage infecting Ralstonia solanacearum was isolated in Thailand (ϕRP15). ϕRP15 virions showed unique morphology with star-like protrusions attached to the base plate via a stalk. The 168 kb genome sequence of ϕRP15 was determined and found to encode 17 tRNAs (plus two tRNA pseudogenes). Ten of these phage-encoded tRNAs corresponded to codons that are relatively abundant in the phage but rare in the host, while others matched to codons frequent in both phage and host. Phylogenetic and proteomic analyses demonstrate that ϕRP15 forms a clade with Delftia phage ϕW-14, which in turn is placed as a sister group of viunalikeviruses. The hosts of ϕRP15 and ϕW-14 (R. solanacearum and Delftia acidovorans, respectively) belong to Betaproteobacteria, while most of the hosts of viunalikeviruses are of the Enterobacteriaceae belonging to Gammaproteobacteria. These phages may have evolved closely associated with their hosts that have very different life-styles in the natural habitats.

  CSV Title: A comparison of simultaneous temperature and humidity observations from the SW and NE slopes of Kilimanjaro: The role of slope aspect and differential land-cover in controlling mountain climate
  CSV Abstract: The recession of the current ice fields near the summit of Kilimanjaro has been shown to be controlled largely by climate. Despite detailed research into summit climate, including mass and energy balance modelling, understanding Kilimanjaro as a whole has been limited by lack of observations on the mountain slopes. Analysis of hourly air temperatures, relative humidities and vapour pressures from 22 weather stations installed between September 2012 and 2015 across the mountain from south-west to north-east are presented for the first time. Moisture is shown to move upslope on both sides of the mountain during the afternoon. The north-east slope is less humid and warmer on average than the south-west slope. Temperature differences between slopes reach 4–5 °C during the morning in the rainforest zone (2000–2500 m) and on the crater wall (5000–5550 m). Slope differences are broadly similar in size to local contrasts within the south-west slope caused by the rainforest (at 1890 m) and ice fields (at 5800 m). Although both slopes show similar moisture regimes, there are contrasts in moisture content particularly in the zone just above the current rainforest limit (3000–3200 m). This decoupling extends up to 5000 m in the afternoon because the upslope transport of moisture is both weaker and delayed on the NE slope. At night the upper slopes are highly correlated implying that free-air moisture is the dominant source. Very moist events at crater level tend to be associated with widespread moistening across the whole mountain. These results can be used both to argue for and against the role of deforestation being an important influence on summit climate and therefore ice field recession.

  CSV Title: Development of a multiplex lateral flow strip test for foot-and-mouth disease virus detection using monoclonal antibodies
  CSV Abstract: Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is one of the world's most highly contagious animal diseases with tremendous economic consequences. A rapid and specific test for FMD diagnosis at the site of a suspected outbreak is crucial for the implementation of control measures. This project developed a multiplex lateral flow immunochromatographic strip test (multiplex-LFI) for the rapid detection and serotyping of FMD viruses. The monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against serotypes O, A, and Asia 1 were used as capture mAbs. The mAbs were conjugated with fluorescein, rhodamine or biotin for serotype O, A and Asia 1, respectively. The detection mAbs which consisted of a serotype-independent mAb in combination with one serotype A-specific mAb and one Asia 1-specific mAb, were each colloidal gold-conjugated. The strips used in this study contained one control line and three test lines, which corresponded to one of the three serotypes, O, A or Asia 1. The newly developed multiplex-LFI strip test specifically identified serotype O (n= 46), A (n= 45) and Asia 1 (n= 17) in all tested field isolates. The sensitivity of this strip test was comparable to the double antibody sandwich ELISA for serotypes O and A, but lower than the ELISA for serotype Asia 1. The multiplex-LFI strip test identified all tissue suspensions from animals that were experimentally inoculated with serotypes O, A or Asia 1. FMD viruses were detected in 38% and 50% of the swab samples from the lesion areas of experimentally inoculated sheep for serotypes O and A, respectively. The capability of the multiplex-LFI strip tests to produce rapid results with high specificity for FMD viruses of multiple serotypes makes this test a valuable tool to detect FMD viruses at outbreak sites.

  CSV Abstract: We examine whether a time lag exists before the network position of a software service affects its performance. Moreover, we analyze different time lags, using empirical data about software services and their usage for creating composite services. Our results show that software services in central positions (i.e., high betweenness centrality) attract users the most. The highest effect exhibits, if the time lag is 26–32 months. Our findings are relevant, as they can guide developers in marketing their software services and are expected to impact innovation studies regarding the importance of considering time lags and analyzing complementary knowledge.

  CSV Title: London's local high streets: The problems, potential and complexities of mixed street corridors
  CSV Abstract: This paper examines the 'problem' of mixed street corridors through the lens of London's local high streets (main streets). It theorises the nature of these streets, developing an analytical framework through which to investigate them through their four high street functions - physical fabric, exchange, movement and real estate - and the overarching question of management. It then explores the challenges and issues facing such streets in British cities before turning specifically to the London case. Through a complimentary set of empirical investigations, London's local high streets are explored across two scales, in terms of their strategic city-wide contribution, and through their local impact. They are examined both with regard to their situation today and their future potential. The policy context across London is also, explored, before conclusions and recommendations are drawn out of relevance to London and to mixed street corridors across the world. Mixed streets represent a particularly 'wicked' problem for cities, yet, as the research shows, they are also some of the most important spaces in the city, of far greater complexity and local significance than is realised, and possessing untapped strategic growth potential.

  CSV Title: Shared gut, but distinct oral microbiota composition in primary Sjögren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus
  CSV Abstract: Objective: Alterations in the microbiota composition of the gastro-intestinal tract are suspected to be involved in the etiopathogenesis of two closely related systemic inflammatory autoimmune diseases: primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Our objective was to assess whether alterations in gut and oral microbiota compositions are specific for pSS and SLE. Methods: 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was performed on fecal samples from 39 pSS patients, 30 SLE patients and 965 individuals from the general population, as well as on buccal swab and oral washing samples from the same pSS and SLE patients. Alpha-diversity, beta-diversity and relative abundance of individual bacteria were used as outcome measures. Multivariate analyses were performed to test associations between individual bacteria and disease phenotype, taking age, sex, body-mass index, proton-pump inhibitor use and sequencing-depth into account as possible confounding factors. Results: Fecal microbiota composition from pSS and SLE patients differed significantly from population controls, but not between pSS and SLE. pSS and SLE patients were characterized by lower bacterial richness, lower Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and higher relative abundance of Bacteroides species in fecal samples compared with population controls. Oral microbiota composition differed significantly between pSS patients and SLE patients, which could partially be explained by oral dryness in pSS patients. Conclusions: pSS and SLE patients share similar alterations in gut microbiota composition, distinguishing patients from individuals in the general population, while oral microbiota composition shows disease-specific differences between pSS and SLE patients.

  CSV Title: Poly-beta-amino-esters nano-vehicles based drug delivery system for cartilage
  CSV Abstract: The efficient delivery of therapeutic molecules to the cartilage of joints is a major obstacle in developing useful therapeutic interventions; hence, a targeted drug delivery system for this tissue is critical. We have overcome the challenge by developing a system that employs electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged constituents of cartilage and a positively charged polymer, poly-beta amino esters (PBAEs). We have demonstrated cartilage uptake of dexamethasone (DEX) covalently bound to the PBAE was doubled and retention in tissues prolonged compared to the equivalent dose of the commercial drug formulation. Moreover, no adverse effects on chondrocytes were found. Our data also show that PBAEs can bind not only healthy cartilage tissues but also enzymatically treated cartilage mimicking early stages of OA. Our PBAEs-prodrug technology's advantages are fourfold; the specificity and efficacy of its targeting mechanism for cartilage, the ease of its production and the low-cost nature of the delivery system.

  CSV Title: Three-dimensional hypoxic culture of human mesenchymal stem cells encapsulated in a photocurable, biodegradable polymer hydrogel: A potential injectable cellular product for nucleus pulposus regeneration
  CSV Abstract: Nucleus pulposus (NP) tissue damage can induce detrimental mechanical stresses and strains on the intervertebral disc, leading to disc degeneration. This study demonstrates the potential of a novel, photo-curable, injectable, synthetic polymer hydrogel (pHEMA-co-APMA grafted with polyamidoamine (PAA)) to encapsulate and differentiate human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) towards a NP phenotype under hypoxic conditions which could be used to restore NP tissue function and mechanical properties. Encapsulated hMSC cultured in media (hMSC and chondrogenic) displayed good cell viability up to day 14. The genotoxicity effects of ultraviolet (UV) on hMSC activity confirmed the acceptability of 2.5 min of UV light exposure to cells. Cytotoxicity investigations revealed that hMSC cultured in media containing p(HEMA-co-APMA) grafted with PAA degradation product (10% and 20% v/v concentration) for 14 days significantly decreased the initial hMSC adhesion ability and proliferation rate from 24 hrs to day 14. Successful differentiation of encapsulated hMSC within hydrogels towards chondrogenesis was observed with elevated expression levels of aggrecan and collagen II when cultured in chondrogenic media under hypoxic conditions, in comparison with culture in hMSC media for 14 days. Characterization of the mechanical properties revealed a significant decrease in stiffness and modulus values of cellular hydrogels in comparison with acellular hydrogels at both day 7 and day 14. These results demonstrate the potential use of an in vivo photo-curable injectable, synthetic hydrogel with encapsulated hMSC for application in the repair and regeneration of NP tissue. © 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

  CSV Title: Seeing futures now: Emergent US and UK views on shale development, climate change and energy systems
  CSV Abstract: Shale development – extraction of oil and gas from shale rock formations using hydraulic fracturing or ‘fracking’ – has become a critical focus for energy debates in the US and UK. In both countries, potential industry expansion into new areas for shale extraction is expected to produce a wide range of environmental and social impacts and to change the configuration of future energy systems. To engage with emergent views on these complex, multi-scale issues, we held a series of day-long deliberation workshops (two in the US and two in the UK) designed and facilitated for diverse groups of people to discuss a range of possible consequences and meanings of shale development. Amid nuanced differences between and within national contexts, notable similarities in views were tracked across all four workshops. Concerns in common were not limited to specific risks such as water contamination. Participants also questioned whether shale development was compatible with their visions for and concerns about the longer-term future – including views on impacts and causes of climate change, societal dependency on fossil fuels, development of alternative energy technologies, the perceived short-term objectives of government and industry agencies, and obligations to act responsibly toward future generations. Extending prior qualitative research on shale development and on energy systems change, this research brings open-ended and cross-national public deliberation inquiry to bear on broader issues of climate change, responsibility, and ideas about how shale development might undermine or reinforce the energy systems that people consider important for the future.

  CSV Title: Urban-rural divides in preferences for wetland conservation in Malaysia
  CSV Abstract: We examined the preferences for wetland conservation among urban and rural dwellers in Malaysia. A choice experiment using face-to-face interviews with urban and rural households was employed. Wetland conservation alternatives were described in terms of environmental protection zones, biodiversity protection, recreational services and flood. Each alternative was connected to a cost for the household, which was a reduction in subsidies for daily goods. Using a latent class model, we identified three groups with distinctly different preferences. The first group comprised mainly rural people with negative willingness to pay for conservation, while the second group included mostly urban people who favored wetland conservation and exhibited positive preference for wetland attributes. The third group was also consisted of mainly urban people who exhibited both negative and positive preferences toward different aspects of conservation. All three groups, however, asserted a strong preference for significant flood risk reduction. The results indicated potential conflicts over wetland conservation impacts and targets. Accordingly, the divide in preferences should be taken into account in policy-making, and the insights provided here may inform efforts to avoid conflict across the population.

  CSV Title: Scale-appropriate mechanization impacts on productivity among smallholders: Evidence from rice systems in the mid-hills of Nepal
  CSV Abstract: Smallholder farmers in the mid-hills of Nepal are facing an acute labor shortage due to out-migration which, in general, has affected the capacity to achieve timely crop establishment, harvest, and inter-cultural operations. These effects are more visible in the case of labor-intensive crops such as rice and promoting higher levels of rural mechanization has emerged as the primary policy response option. Nevertheless, quantitative evidence for the ability of mechanization to offset the adverse effects of shortages increasing labor prices in these systems is largely absent. This study investigates the impacts associated with adoption of mini-tillers (5 to 9 horsepower) for land preparation on smallholder rice productivity in the mid-hills of Nepal. We use an endogenous switching regression that accounts for both observed and unobserved sources of heterogeneity between mini-tiller adopters and non-adopters. Findings demonstrate that rising on-farm rural wage rates and an emerging decline in draft animal availability are driving adoption of the mini-tiller. Among users, the mini-tiller increased rice productivity by 1,110 kg/ha (27%). Further, regression results suggest that mini-tiller non-adopters would be able to increase their rice productivity by 1,250 kg/ha (26%) if they adopt. Moreover, our analysis revealed that very small farms (≤0.25 ha) that adopt mini-tillers are benefited the most in terms of gains in rice productivity. These findings support policies that favor the expansion of small-scale mechanization in the hill production ecologies of South Asia and highlight the need to foster the emergence of an associated service economy that will permit smallholders access to capital-intensive machinery such as the mini-tiller.

  CSV Title: Exploring the cell–protein–mineral interfaces: Interplay of silica (nano)rods@collagen biocomposites with human dermal fibroblasts
  CSV Abstract: The benefits of associating biological polymers with nanomaterials within functional bionanocomposite hydrogels have already been evidenced both in vitro and in vivo. However their development as effective biomaterials requires to understand and tune the interactions at the cell–protein–mineral ternary interface. With this purpose, we have studied here the impact of silica (nano)rods on the structural and rheological properties of type I collagen hydrogels ​and on the behavior of human dermal fibroblasts. High collagen concentrations were beneficial to the material mechanical properties, whereas silica rods could exert a positive effect on these at both low and high content. Electron microscopy evidenced strong bio–mineral interactions, emphasizing the true composite nature of these materials. In contrast, adhesion and proliferation studies showed that, despite these interactions, fibroblasts can discriminate between the protein and the inorganic phases and penetrate the collagen network to limit direct contact with silica. Such a divergence between physicochemical characteristics and biological responses has major implications for the prediction of the in vivo fate of nanocomposite biomaterials.

  CSV Title: Technologies and infrastructures underpinning future CO2 value chains: A comprehensive review and comparative analysis
  CSV Abstract: In addition to carbon capture and storage, efforts are also being focussed on using captured CO2, both directly as a working fluid and in chemical conversion processes, as a key strategy for mitigating climate change and achieving resource efficiency. These processes require large amounts of energy, which should come from sustainable and, ideally, renewable sources. A strong value chain is required to support the production of valuable products from CO2. A value chain is a network of technologies and infrastructures (such as conversion, transportation, storage) along with its associated activities (such as sourcing raw materials, processing, logistics, inventory management, waste management) required to convert low-value resources to high-value products and energy services, and deliver them to customers. A CO2 value chain involves production of CO2 (involving capture and purification), technologies that convert CO2 and other materials into valuable products, sourcing of low-carbon energy to drive all of the transformation processes required to convert CO2 to products (including production of hydrogen, syngas, methane etc.), transport of energy and materials to where they are needed, managing inventory levels of resources, and delivering the products to customers, all in order to create value (economic, environmental, social etc.). Technologies underpinning future CO2 value chains were examined. CO2 conversion technologies, such as urea production, Sabatier synthesis, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, hydrogenation to methanol, dry reforming, hydrogenation to formic acid and electrochemical reduction, were assessed and compared based on key performance indicators such as: CAPEX, OPEX, electricity consumption, TRL, product price, net CO2 consumption etc. Technologies for transport and storage of key resources are also discussed. This work lays the foundation for a comprehensive whole-system value chain analysis, modelling and optimisation.

  CSV Title: Dataset of liver proteins changed in eu- and hypothyroid female rats upon in vivo exposure to hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD)
  CSV Abstract: Female Wistar rats with different thyroid status (eu-, hypothyroid) were exposed to 0, 3 or 30 mg/kg body weight of the flame retardant HBCD for 7 days. Changes in protein patterns obtained by 2D-DIGE were evaluated, and different animal groups compared taking into account their exposure and thyroid status. Proteins significantly altered in abundance in any of these comparisons were identified by mass spectrometry. These data, together with hormone data of the animals, are discussed in "Hexa-bromocyclododecane (HBCD) induced changes in the liver proteome of eu- and hypothyroid female rats" (Miller et al., 2016) [1].

  CSV Title: Sweet taste and nutrient value subdivide rewarding dopaminergic neurons in drosophila
  CSV Abstract: Dopaminergic neurons provide reward learning signals in mammals and insects [1-4]. Recent work in Drosophila has demonstrated that water-reinforcing dopaminergic neurons are different to those for nutritious sugars [5]. Here, we tested whether the sweet taste and nutrient properties of sugar reinforcement further subdivide the fly reward system. We found that dopaminergic neurons expressing the OAMB octopamine receptor [6] specifically convey the short-term reinforcing effects of sweet taste [4]. These dopaminergic neurons project to the β′<inf>2</inf> and γ<inf>4</inf> regions of the mushroom body lobes. In contrast, nutrient-dependent long-term memory requires different dopaminergic neurons that project to the γ<inf>5b</inf> regions, and it can be artificially reinforced by those projecting to the β lobe and adjacent α<inf>1</inf> region. Surprisingly, whereas artificial implantation and expression of short-term memory occur in satiated flies, formation and expression of artificial long-term memory require flies to be hungry. These studies suggest that short-term and long-term sugar memories have different physiological constraints. They also demonstrate further functional heterogeneity within the rewarding dopaminergic neuron population.

  CSV Title: Functional activity and white matter microstructure reveal the independent effects of age of acquisition and proficiency on second-language learning
  CSV Abstract: Two key factors govern how bilingual speakers neurally maintain two languages: the speakers’ second language age of acquisition (AoA) and their subsequent proficiency. However, the relative roles of these two factors have been difficult to disentangle given that the two can be closely correlated, and most prior studies have examined the two factors in isolation. Here, we combine functional magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion tensor imaging to identify specific brain areas that are independently modulated by AoA and proficiency in second language speakers. First-language Mandarin Chinese speakers who are second language speakers of English were scanned as they performed a picture-word matching task in either language. In the same session we also acquired diffusion-weighted scans to assess white matter microstructure, along with behavioural measures of language proficiency prior to entering the scanner. Results reveal gray- and white-matter networks involving both the left and right hemisphere that independently vary as a function of a second-language speaker's AoA and proficiency, focused on the superior temporal gyrus, middle and inferior frontal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, and the basal ganglia. These results indicate that proficiency and AoA explain separate functional and structural networks in the bilingual brain, which we interpret as suggesting distinct types of plasticity for age-dependent effects (i.e., AoA) versus experience and/or predisposition (i.e., proficiency).

  CSV Title: Maintenance and emergency management with an integrated indoor/outdoor navigation support
  CSV Abstract: Large and complex infrastructures as industry plants and hospitals are vulnerable to natural, man-made disasters, and causality events. In this paper, we present a solution addressing the guiding personnel during maintenance and/or emergency conditions. The aim is to reduce the time needed to react and to cope with organization and maintenance support, while facilitating communication, and indoor/outdoor navigation. The solution is based on the formalization of protocol, the modelling of knowledge for navigation, the algorithms and the development of a mobile application and correspond-ing server device for integrated indoor/outdoor navigation. The navigation algorithms are based on low costs mobile sensors and Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter. The solution has been validated and tried out within a large medical infrastructure, thus demonstrating the validity of the identified modalities and procedures, measuring the advantage from both qualitative and quantitative aspects. The indoor navigation solution has been compared with other former solutions based on classical Kalman and dead reckoning.

  CSV Title: A Diencephalic Dopamine Source Provides Input to the Superior Colliculus, where D1 and D2 Receptors Segregate to Distinct Functional Zones
  CSV Abstract: Modulation of neural responses is frequently observed in the superior colliculus (SC), a retinorecipient midbrain structure that controls orienting and the localization of attention. Although behavioral contingencies that influence SC responses are well documented, the neural pathways and molecular mechanisms responsible for this modulation are not completely understood. Here, we illustrate a dopaminergic system that strongly impacts neural responses in the SC. After using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to detail the transcriptome of dopamine-related genes in the SC, we show that D1 receptors are enriched in the superficial visual SC, while D2 receptors segregate to the intermediate multimodal/motor SC. Retrograde injections into the SC consistently label A13, a small dopamine cell group located in the zona incerta. We surmise that A13 mimics dopaminergic effects that we observed in SC slices, which suggests that dopamine in the SC may reduce the tendency of an animal to orient or attend to salient stimuli. Bolton et al. have provided a detailed anatomical, genetic, and electrophysiological characterization of the dopamine system in the midbrain superior colliculus. These findings lay the groundwork for understanding how dopamine may influence the colliculus's ability to allocate attention and orienting movements to specific regions of space.

  CSV Title: Scalable continuous production of high quality HKUST-1 via conventional and microwave heating
  CSV Abstract: Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are materials with large surface areas and internal volumes, which result in a number of useful properties for applications such as catalysis, separations and gas storage. However, MOFs are challenging to produce at a large scale creating a barrier to becoming truly viable alternatives to current technologies. As a first step towards industrial scale manufacture, we demonstrate here the first scalable, continuous synthesis of high-quality HKUST-1 using ethanol as the solvent, resulting in a greener and potentially much more economical process (as solvent does not decompose and thus can be recycled). We also show that microwave heating can be used to produce HKUST-1 continuously, in timescales several orders of magnitude faster than by conventional heating. We demonstrate a novel approach to microwave assisted synthesis of HKUST-1, based on a recycle loop with microwave irradiation, which is scalable under both batch and continuous conditions and allows an independent control of microwave irradiation regime and the overall reaction time. The use of microwave heating for continuous production of HKUST-1 enabled STY of 400,000 kg m−3 d−1, which is higher than any production rates reported to date, even when using the preferred high yield solvent, DMF, and is 17 times more than the highest production rates reported to date for HKUST-1 in ‘ethanol-only’ systems.

  CSV Title: Repeatability and reproducibility of longitudinal relaxation rate in 12 small-animal MRI systems
  CSV Abstract:  Background: Many translational MR biomarkers derive from measurements of the water proton longitudinal relaxation rate R 1 , but evidence for between-site reproducibility of R 1 in small-animal MRI is lacking. Objective: To assess R 1 repeatability and multi-site reproducibility in phantoms for preclinical MRI. Methods: R 1 was measured by saturation recovery in 2% agarose phantoms with five nickel chloride concentrations in 12 magnets at 5 field strengths in 11 centres on two different occasions within 1–13 days. R 1 was analysed in three different regions of interest, giving 360 measurements in total. Root-mean-square repeatability and reproducibility coefficients of variation (CoV) were calculated. Propagation of reproducibility errors into 21 translational MR measurements and biomarkers was estimated. Relaxivities were calculated. Dynamic signal stability was also measured. Results: CoV for day-to-day repeatability (N = 180 regions of interest) was 2.34% and for between-centre reproducibility (N = 9 centres) was 1.43%. Mostly, these do not propagate to biologically significant between-centre error, although a few R 1 -based MR biomarkers were found to be quite sensitive even to such small errors in R 1 , notably in myocardial fibrosis, in white matter, and in oxygen-enhanced MRI. The relaxivity of aqueous Ni 2+ in 2% agarose varied between 0.66 s −1 mM −1 at 3 T and 0.94 s −1 mM −1 at 11.7T. Interpretation: While several factors affect the reproducibility of R 1 -based MR biomarkers measured preclinically, between-centre propagation of errors arising from intrinsic equipment irreproducibility should in most cases be small. However, in a few specific cases exceptional efforts might be required to ensure R 1 -reproducibility.

  CSV Title: Proliferation of the biocontrol agent Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. strigae and its impact on indigenous rhizosphere fungal communities in maize under different agro-ecologies
  CSV Abstract: Our objectives were to (1) monitor the proliferation of the biocontrol agent (BCA) Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. strigae strain “Foxy-2”, an effective soil-borne BCA against the parasitic weed Striga hermonthica, in the rhizosphere of maize under different agro-ecologies, and (2) investigate its impact on indigenous rhizosphere fungal community abundance and composition. Field experiments were conducted in Busia and Homa Bay districts in western Kenya during two cropping seasons to account for effects of soil type, climate, growth stage and seasonality. Maize seeds were coated with or without “Foxy-2” and soils were artificially infested with S. hermonthica seeds. One treatment with nitrogen rich organic residues (Tithonia diversifolia) was established to compensate hypothesized resource competition between “Foxy-2” and the indigenous fungal community. Rhizosphere soil samples collected at three growth stages (i.e., EC30, EC60, EC90) of maize were subjected to abundance measurement of “Foxy-2” and total indigenous fungi using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) analysis was used to assess potential alterations in the fungal community composition in response to “Foxy-2” presence. “Foxy-2” proliferated stronger in the soils with a sandy clay texture (Busia) than in those with a loamy sand texture (Homa Bay) and revealed slightly higher abundance in the second season. “Foxy-2” had, however, only a transient suppressive effect on total indigenous fungal abundance which ceased in the second season and was further markedly compensated after addition of T. diversifolia residues. Likewise, community structure of the indigenous fungal community was mainly altered by maize growth stages, but not by “Foxy-2”. In conclusion, no adverse effects of “Foxy-2” inoculation on indigenous fungal rhizosphere communities were observed corroborating the safety of this BCA under the given agro-ecologies.

  CSV Title: Nonlinear dynamic Interactions between flow-induced galloping and shell-like buckling
  CSV Abstract: For an elastic system that is non-conservative but autonomous, subjected for example to time-independent loading by a steadily flowing fluid (air or water), a dangerous bifurcation, such as a sub-critical bifurcation, or a cyclic fold, will trigger a dynamic jump to one or more remote stable attractors. When there is more than one candidate attractor, the one onto which the structure settles can then be indeterminate, being sensitive to infinitesimally small variations in starting conditions or parameters. In this paper we develop and study an archetypal model to explore the nonlinear dynamic interactions between galloping at an incipient sub-critical Hopf bifurcation of a structure with shell-like buckling behaviour that is gravity-loaded to approach a sub-critical pitch-fork bifurcation. For the fluid forces, we draw on the aerodynamic coefficients determined experimentally by Novak for the flow around a bluff body of rectangular cross-section. Meanwhile, for the structural component, we consider a variant of the propped-cantilever model that is widely used to illustrate the sub-critical pitch-fork: within this model a symmetry-breaking imperfection makes the behaviour generic. The compound bifurcation corresponding to simultaneous galloping and buckling is the so-called Takens-Bodganov Cusp. We make a full unfolding of this codimension-3 bifurcation for our archetypal model to explore the adjacent phase-space topologies and their indeterminacies.

  CSV Title: Are scenarios of hydrogen vehicle adoption optimistic? A comparison with historical analogies
  CSV Abstract: There is a large literature exploring possible hydrogen futures, using various modelling and scenario approaches. This paper compares the rates of transition depicted in that literature with a set of historical analogies. These analogies are cases in which alternative-fuelled vehicles have penetrated vehicle markets. The paper suggests that the literature has tended to be optimistic about the possible rate at which hydrogen vehicles might replace oil-based transportation. The paper compares 11 historical adoptions of alternative fuel vehicles with 24 scenarios from 20 studies that depict possible hydrogen futures. All but one of the hydrogen scenarios show vehicle adoption faster than has occurred for hybrid electric vehicles in Japan, the most successful market for hybrids. Several scenarios depict hydrogen transitions occurring at a rate faster than has occurred in any of the historic examples. The paper concludes that scenarios of alternative vehicle adoption should include more pessimistic scenarios alongside optimistic ones.

  CSV Title: Data for efficiency comparison of raw pumice and manganese-modified pumice for removal phenol from aqueous environments—Application of response surface methodology
  CSV Abstract: Present deadest collection was aimed to evaluate the efficiency of raw pumice (RWP) and Mn-modified pumice (MMP). Response surface methodology (RSM) based on the central composite designs (CCD) was applied to evaluate the effects of independent variables including pH, adsorbents dosage, contact time and adsorbate concentration on the response function and the best response values were predicted. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the adsorbents. Based on acquired data, the maximum efficiency removal of phenol was obtained 89.14% and 100% for raw and Mn-modified pumice respectively. The obtained data showed pH was effective parameter on phenol removal among the different variables. Evaluation of data using isotherms and kinetics models showed the fitted with Langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order kinetic for both adsorbents. According to obtained data was observed that modification of pumice can improve the efficiency removal of phenol to meet the effluent standards.

  CSV Title: An ultrasonic orthopaedic surgical device based on a cymbal transducer
  CSV Abstract: An ultrasonic orthopaedic surgical device is presented, where the ultrasonic actuation relies on a modification of the classical cymbal transducer. All current devices consist of a Langevin ultrasonic transducer with a tuned cutting blade attached, where resonance is required to provide sufficient vibrational amplitude to cut bone. However, this requirement restricts the geometry and offers little opportunity to propose miniaturised devices or complex blades. The class V flextensional cymbal transducer is proposed here as the basis for a new design, where the cymbal delivers the required vibrational amplitude, and the design of the attached cutting insert can be tailored for the required cut. Consequently, the device can be optimised to deliver an accurate and precise cutting capability. A prototype device is presented, based on the cymbal configuration and designed to operate at 25.5 kHz with a displacement amplitude of 30 μm at 300 V. Measurements of vibrational and impedance responses elucidate the mechanical and electrical characteristics of the device. Subsequent cutting tests on rat femur demonstrate device performance consistent with a commercial Langevin-based ultrasonic device and show that cutting is achieved using less electrical power and a lower piezoceramic volume. Histological analysis exhibits a higher proportion of live cells in the region around the cut site for the cymbal device than for a powered sagittal or a manual saw, demonstrating the potential for the ultrasonic device to result in faster healing.

  CSV Title: Ventral striatal activity links adversity and reward processing in children
  CSV Abstract: Adversity impacts many aspects of psychological and physical development including reward-based learning and decision-making. Mechanisms relating adversity and reward processing in children, however, remain unclear. Here, we show that adversity is associated with potentiated learning from positive outcomes and impulsive decision-making, but unrelated to learning from negative outcomes. We then show via functional magnetic resonance imaging that the link between adversity and reward processing is partially mediated by differences in ventral striatal response to rewards. The findings suggest that early-life adversity is associated with alterations in the brain's sensitivity to rewards accounting, in part, for the link between adversity and altered reward processing in children.

  CSV Title: Grip strength in mice with joint inflammation: A rheumatology function test sensitive to pain and analgesia
  CSV Abstract: Grip strength deficit is a measure of pain-induced functional disability in rheumatic disease. We tested whether this parameter and tactile allodynia, the standard pain measure in preclinical studies, show parallels in their response to analgesics and basic mechanisms. Mice with periarticular injections of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) in the ankles showed periarticular immune infiltration and synovial membrane alterations, together with pronounced grip strength deficits and tactile allodynia measured with von Frey hairs. However, inflammation-induced tactile allodynia lasted longer than grip strength alterations, and therefore did not drive the functional deficits. Oral administration of the opioid drugs oxycodone (1–8 mg/kg) and tramadol (10–80 mg/kg) induced a better recovery of grip strength than acetaminophen (40–320 mg/kg) or the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ibuprofen (10–80 mg/kg) or celecoxib (40–160 mg/kg); these results are consistent with their analgesic efficacy in humans. Functional impairment was generally a more sensitive indicator of drug-induced analgesia than tactile allodynia, as drug doses that attenuated grip strength deficits showed little or no effect on von Frey thresholds. Finally, ruthenium red (a nonselective TRP antagonist) or the in vivo ablation of TRPV1-expressing neurons with resiniferatoxin abolished tactile allodynia without altering grip strength deficits, indicating that the neurobiology of tactile allodynia and grip strength deficits differ. In conclusion, grip strength deficits are due to a distinct type of pain that reflects an important aspect of the human pain experience, and therefore merits further exploration in preclinical studies to improve the translation of new analgesics from bench to bedside.

  CSV Title: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and autologous CD133-positive stem-cell therapy in liver cirrhosis (REALISTIC): an open-label, randomised, controlled phase 2 trial
  CSV Abstract: Background Results of small-scale studies have suggested that stem-cell therapy is safe and effective in patients with liver cirrhosis, but no adequately powered randomised controlled trials have been done. We assessed the safety and efficacy of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and haemopoietic stem-cell infusions in patients with liver cirrhosis. Methods This multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled phase 2 trial was done in three UK hospitals and recruited patients with compensated liver cirrhosis and MELD scores of 11·0–15·5. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive standard care (control), treatment with subcutaneous G-CSF (lenograstim) 15 μg/kg for 5 days, or treatment with G-CSF for 5 days followed by leukapheresis and intravenous infusion of three doses of CD133-positive haemopoietic stem cells (0·2 × 106 cells per kg per infusion). Randomisation was done by Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit staff with a minimisation algorithm that stratified by trial site and cause of liver disease. The coprimary outcomes were improvement in severity of liver disease (change in MELD) at 3 months and the trend of change in MELD score over time. Analyses were done in the modified intention-to-treat population, which included all patients who received at least one day of treatment. Safety was assessed on the basis of the treatment received. This trial was registered at Current Controlled Trials on Nov 18, 2009; ISRCTN, number 91288089; and the European Clinical Trials Database, number 2009-010335-41. Findings Between May 18, 2010, and Feb 26, 2015, 27 patients were randomly assigned to the standard care, 26 to the G-CSF group, and 28 to the G-CSF plus stem-cell infusion group. Median change in MELD from day 0 to 90 was −0·5 (IQR −1·5 to 1·1) in the standard care group, −0·5 (−1·7 to 0·5) in the G-CSF group, and −0·5 (−1·3 to 1·0) in the G-CSF plus stem-cell infusion group. We found no evidence of differences between the treatment groups and control group in the trends of MELD change over time (p=0·55 for the G-CSF group vs standard care and p=0·75 for the G-CSF plus stem-cell infusion group vs standard care). Serious adverse events were more frequent the in G-CSF and stem-cell infusion group (12 [43%] patients) than in the G-CSF (three [11%] patients) and standard care (three [12%] patients) groups. The most common serious adverse events were ascites (two patients in the G-CSF group and two patients in the G-CSF plus stem-cell infusion group, one of whom was admitted to hospital with ascites twice), sepsis (four patients in the G-CSF plus stem-cell infusion group), and encephalopathy (three patients in the G-CSF plus stem-cell infusion group, one of whom was admitted to hospital with encephalopathy twice). Three patients died, including one in the standard care group (variceal bleed) and two in the G-CSF and stem-cell infusion group (one myocardial infarction and one progressive liver disease). Interpretation G-CSF with or without haemopoietic stem-cell infusion did not improve liver dysfunction or fibrosis and might be associated with increased frequency of adverse events compared with standard care.

  CSV Title: Genetic and morphometric evidence for parallel evolution of the Globigerinella calida morphotype
  CSV Abstract: Molecular genetic investigations of the highly abundant extant planktonic foraminifera plexus Globigerinella siphonifera/. Globigerinella calida have recently shown this group to be the genetically most diverse one within planktonic foraminifera, separating it into 12 distinct genetic types belonging to three main genetic lineages. Independently, several morphological or physiological variants have been described within the group, but the correlation between the high genetic diversity and the phenotypic variability remains unclear. In this study, we combine genetic data with morphometric analyses of shell shape and porosity of genotyped individuals of the different genetic lineages. Our morphometric measurements suggest a differentiation of three morphotypes within the plexus, two of which possess the elongated chambers described as a typical trait of G. calida. These two morphotypes with elongated chambers are associated with two distinct genetic lineages. The G. calida morphology therefore appears to have evolved twice in parallel. Unexpectedly, we show that the two morphotypes with elongated chambers can be separated from each other by characters seen in the lateral view of their shells. This implies that the taxonomy of the extant members of the genus Globigerinella should be revised. A comparison with the original descriptions and type specimens of members of the genus shows that two genetic types of one major lineage correspond to G. calida. The second group with elongated chambers is associated with a recently diverged genetic type and we propose to reinstate the name Globigerinella radians for this distinct form. The remaining nine of the 12 genetic types correspond to the G. siphonifera morphology, and in the absence of evidence for morphological differentiation, they form a paraphyletic morpho-taxon. Our results highlight the prevalence of parallelism in the evolution of shell morphology in planktonic foraminifera even at the lowest level of relatedness represented by genetic types.

  CSV Title: Paracrine Crosstalk between Fibroblasts and ER+ Breast Cancer Cells Creates an IL1β-Enriched Niche that Promotes Tumor Growth
  CSV Abstract: Breast cancer-induced activated fibroblasts support tumor progression. However, the role of normal fibroblasts in tumor progression remains controversial. In this study, we used modified patient-derived organoid cultures and demonstrate that constitutively secreted cytokines from normal breast fibroblasts initiate a paracrine signaling mechanism with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cells, which results in the creation of an interleukin (IL)-1β-enriched microenvironment. We found that this paracrine signaling mechanism is shared between normal and activated fibroblasts. Interestingly, we observed that in reconstructed tumor microenvironment containing autologous ER+ breast cancer cells, activated fibroblasts, and immune cells, tamoxifen is more effective in reducing tumor cell proliferation when this paracrine signaling is blocked. Our findings then suggest that ER+ tumor cells could create a growth-promoting environment without activating stromal fibroblasts and that in breast-conserving surgeries, normal fibroblasts could be a significant modulator of tumor recurrence by enhancing the proliferation of residual breast cancer cells in the tumor-adjacent breast tissue. Breast conserving surgery (BCS) is the standard therapy for low-grade breast cancers. However, BCS carries a greater risk of local recurrence than mastectomy. Therefore, it is important to study the “normal” tissue microenvironment that remains after surgery to understand how this can promote residual tumor cell growth. In this article, Raouf and colleagues used modified patient-derived organoid cultures to demonstrate that constitutively secreted cytokines from normal breast fibroblasts initiate a paracrine signaling mechanism with ER+ breast cancer cells that can promote cancer cell growth.

  CSV Title: Lead-induced heat shock protein (HSP70)and metallothionein (MT)gene expression in the embryos of African catfish Clarias gariepinus (Burchell, 1822)
  CSV Abstract: The enhanced expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs)and metallothionein (MT)can be detected in response to many environmental stressors, including exposure to heavy metals. We identified partial mRNA sequences for beta2-microglobulin (ß2m), heat shock cognate 70 kDa protein (HSP70), and MT in embryos of the African catfish Clarias gariepinus (Burchell, 1822). Levels of these transcripts were assessed using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-QPCR)after embryos of various stages were exposed to different concentrations of lead nitrate. ß2m gene expression exhibited a continuous increase over time. Neither HSP70 nor MT were upregulated, supporting the well-known sensitivity of these organisms to environmental pollutants. Interestingly, the partial MT and HSP70 mRNA sequences revealed an intimate phylogenetic relationship with these proteins in siluriforms. These partial sequences were more closely related to salmoniform proteins than to cypriniform proteins. The expression levels of HSP70 and MT were lower in embryonic tissues exposed to high concentrations of lead (500 µg/L), which impaired the fish's coping strategy via toxication at the cellular level. In conclusion, early developmental stages appear to be particularly vulnerable to lead and fail to activate the typical coping mechanisms. Therefore, these early life stages may not be suitable to characterize concentration-dependent toxicity.

  CSV Title: A special role for the right posterior superior temporal sulcus during speech production
  CSV Abstract: This fMRI study of 24 healthy human participants investigated whether any part of the auditory cortex was more responsive to self-generated speech sounds compared to hearing another person speak. The results demonstrate a double dissociation in two different parts of the auditory cortex. In the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (RpSTS), activation was higher during speech production than listening to auditory stimuli, whereas in bilateral superior temporal gyri (STG), activation was higher for listening to auditory stimuli than during speech production. In the second part of the study, we investigated the function of the identified regions, by examining how activation changed across a range of listening and speech production tasks that systematically varied the demands on acoustic, semantic, phonological and orthographic processing. In RpSTS, activation during auditory conditions was higher in the absence of semantic cues, plausibly indicating increased attention to the spectral-temporal features of auditory inputs. In addition, RpSTS responded in the absence of any auditory inputs when participants were making one-back matching decisions on visually presented pseudowords. After analysing the influence of visual, phonological, semantic and orthographic processing, we propose that RpSTS (i) contributes to short term memory of speech sounds as well as (ii) spectral-temporal processing of auditory input and (iii) may play a role in integrating auditory expectations with auditory input. In contrast, activation in bilateral STG was sensitive to acoustic input and did not respond in the absence of auditory input. The special role of RpSTS during speech production therefore merits further investigation if we are to fully understand the neural mechanisms supporting speech production during speech acquisition, adult life, hearing loss and after brain injury.

  CSV Title: Effect of polymer branching on degradation during inkjet printing
  CSV Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate the potential of high molecular weight hyperbranched methacrylate polymers for inkjet printing. Using the Strathclyde method, a series of hyperbranched poly (methylmethacrylate) polymers of increasing branch density were prepared. All hyperbranched polymers show both a significantly greater maximum printable concentration compared to equivalent linear polymers with implications for faster print speed. Increasing chain branching above a critical value across the molecular weight distribution was found to result in suppression of molecular weight degradation. This resistance to molecular degradation is because the longest chain segment being much smaller, such that upon jetting the polymer rapidly retains its thermodynamically stable Gaussian coil conformation and the full force of the constrictional flow in the print head is not passed on to the polymer and degradation is supressed. We further go on to show using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance that degradation occurs via a free radical chain scission mechanism.

  CSV Title: Closed-channel culture system for efficient and reproducible differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into islet cells
  CSV Abstract: Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are thought to be a promising cell-source solution for regenerative medicine due to their indefinite proliferative potential and ability to differentiate to functional somatic cells. However, issues remain with regard to achieving reproducible differentiation of cells with the required functionality for realizing human transplantation therapies and with regard to reducing the potential for bacterial or fungal contamination. To meet these needs, we have developed a closed-channel culture device and corresponding control system. Uniformly-sized spheroidal hPSCs aggregates were formed inside wells within a closed-channel and maintained continuously throughout the culture process. Functional islet-like endocrine cell aggregates were reproducibly induced following a 30-day differentiation protocol. Our system shows an easily scalable, novel method for inducing PSC differentiation with both purity and functionality.

  CSV Title:  Repeat dose exposure of PM 2.5 triggers the disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in SD rats 
  CSV Abstract:  Epidemiological evidence suggests that fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) in air pollution promotes the formation of deep venous thrombosis. However, no evidence is available on the effects of PM 2.5 lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). For the first time, this study explored the effects of PM 2.5 on DIC via coagulation disorders in vivo. SD rats received intratracheal instillation of PM 2.5 once every three days for one month. Doppler ultrasound showed that the pulmonary valve (PV) and aortic valve (AV) peak flow were decreased after exposure to PM 2.5 . Fibrin deposition and bleeding were observed in lung tissue and vascular endothelial injury was found after exposure to PM 2.5 . Expression of thrombomodulin (TM) in vessel was downregulated after PM 2.5 -treated, whereas the levels of proinflammatory factors and adhesion molecules (IL-6, IL-1β CRP, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) were markedly elevated after exposure to PM 2.5 . Tissue factor (TF) and the coagulation factor of FXa were increased, while vWF was significantly lowered induced by PM 2.5 . Thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) and fibrinolytic factor (t-PA) were elevated, while there was no significantly change in the expression of anticoagulant factors (TFPI and AT-III). To clarify the relationship between PM 2.5 and DIC, we examined the general diagnostic indices of DIC: PM 2.5 prolonged PT and increased the expression of D-dimer but decreased platelet count and fibrinogen. In addition, the gene levels of JAK1 and STAT3 showed an upward trend, whereas there was little effect on JAK2 expression. And inflammatory factors (IL-6, IL-1β and TNF) in blood vessels of were up-reglated in PM 2.5 -treated rats. In summary, our results found that PM 2.5 could induce inflammatory response, vascular endothelial injury and prothrombotic state, eventually resulted in DIC. It will provide new evidence for a link between PM 2.5 and cardiovascular disease.

  CSV Title: Solvent effects on heterogeneous synthesis of cardanol-bonded cellulose thermoplastics
  CSV Abstract: Focusing on a one-pot heterogeneous process, we synthesized a promising mixed cellulose ester, cardanol-bonded cellulose thermoplastic, with bonding a short side chain (acetyl) and a long one (a derivative of cardanol). In the heterogeneous process, reaction solvents are important factors in the reactivity of long and short side chain moieties on cellulose. Investigating various kinds of solvents, we found that the solvents’ affinity for cellulose was an important parameter for the reactivity of long side chain moiety, and the polarity of solvents affected the reaction ratio of long and short chain moieties. Especially, when the middle-basic type of the solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide or N-methylpyrrolidone was used, the obtained thermoplastics had adequate degree of substitutions of long and short chain moieties, and sufficient mechanical properties (50 MPa of bending strength, and 1.4 GPa of bending modulus) to use in durable products such as electric devices in addition to general products.

  CSV Title: Seasonal patterns of rainfall and river isotopic chemistry in northern Amazonia (Guyana): From the headwater to the regional scale
  CSV Abstract: We use first field-based observations of precipitation and river isotopic chemistry from a three-year study (2009-2011) in rainforest and nearby savannah in central Guyana at the northern rim of the Amazon rainforest to establish the quality of modelled or remotely-sensed datasets. Our 3 years of data capture a reduced rainfall regime in 2009 and an extended wet season in 2010, in contrast to the widely documented Amazonian floods in 2009 and droughts in 2010. Comparisons of observed precipitation with satellite derived TRMM and ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis precipitation show that both of these data sets capture the general pattern of seasonality, but substantially underestimate rainfall amounts in the primary wet season (by up to 50% and 72% respectively). The TRMM dataset is generally better at characterising the main dry season from September to December but the ERA-Interim model can overestimate precipitation in the dry season by up to 175%. Our new data on isotopic chemistry of river waters show that δ2H/δ18O values in this region are broadly consistent with interpolated global datasets of modelled precipitation isotopic signatures. The dominance of isotopically lighter water derived from the rains of the ITCZ during the wet season provides evidence of the close coupling of water chemistry of headwater rivers on the northern rim of Amazonia to the positioning of the ITCZ over the region. Our results highlight the challenge in understanding and representing local scale hydrological and biogeochemical characteristics using regional scale model data. We argue that combining point and local scale field data with larger scale model data is necessary to progress towards a comprehensive understanding of climate-hydrology interactions in Amazonia. © 2014.

  CSV Title: Microbial-induced remediation of Zn2+ pollution based on the capture and utilization of carbon dioxide
  CSV Abstract: Background: Microbial-induced remediation of Zn2+ pollution based on the capture and utilization of carbon dioxide was investigated. In this study, carbon dioxide was absorbed and transformed into carbonate ions under the enzymatic action of Paenibacillus mucilaginosus, which was being utilized to mineralize Zn2+. Results: The compositional and morphological properties of the precipitations were studied using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The thermal properties of the precipitates were investigated by thermogravimetric-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC). The FTIR results confirmed that the functional groups of the precipitates were CO2 − and OH−. The XRD and EDS patterns showed that basic zinc carbonate could be obtained successfully by Microbial-induced remediation. The SEM micrographs demonstrated that the precipitates were in the nanometer range with sizes of 100-200 nm and were sphere-like in shape. Conclusions: The TG-DSC results showed that weight loss of the precipitates occurred around 253°C. The FTIR and TG-DSC results were in accord with the XRD and EDS results and proved again that the precipitates were basic zinc carbonate. This work thus demonstrates a new method for processing Zn2+ pollution based on the utilization of carbon dioxide.

  CSV Title: Human content filtering in Twitter: The influence of metadata
  CSV Abstract: Social micro-blogging systems such as Twitter are designed for rapid and informal communication from a large potential number of participants. Due to the volume of content received, human users must typically skim their timeline of received content and exercise judgement in selecting items for consumption, necessitating a selection process based on heuristics and content meta-data. This selection process is not well understood, yet is important due to its potential use in content management systems. In this research we have conducted an open online experiment in which participants are shown quantitative and qualitative meta-data describing two pieces of Twitter content. Without revealing the text of the tweet, participants are asked to make a selection. We observe the decisions made from 239 surveys and discover insights into human behaviour on decision making for content selection. We find that for qualitative meta-data consumption decisions are driven by online friendship and for quantitative meta-data the largest numerical value presented influences choice. Overall, the 'number of retweets' is found to be the most influential quantitative meta-data, while displaying multiple cues about an author's identity provides the strongest qualitative meta-data. When both quantitative and qualitative meta-data is presented, it is the qualitative meta-data (friendship information) that drives selection. The results are consistent with application of the Recognition heuristic, which postulates that when faced with constrained decision-making, humans will tend to exercise judgement based on cues representing familiarity.

  CSV Title: Thermal cycling effects on the durability of a pultruded GFRP material for off-shore civil engineering structures
  CSV Abstract: This paper investigates the effects of thermal cycles on the structural integrity of a pultruded Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP). Through a critical review of current literature alongside a comprehensive experimental campaign, the material's response to cyclic thermal loading has been ascertained, defined by the rate of degradation of its physical, mechanical and visco-elastic properties. Matching sets of both dry and soaked samples conditioned in distilled water for 224 days. Freeze-thaw cycling of both dry and soaked samples was conducted between 20 °C and -10 °C for a total of 300 cycles. Computed Tomography scanning (CT-scan) was undertaken to assess the microstructural physical changes throughout freeze-thaw cycling. After exposure, GFRP samples exhibited a minor decrease in glass transition temperature (Tg) which indicated minor structural degradation. Dry GFRP sample's mechanical response exhibited negligible changes in both tensile and in-plane shear properties. However, as a result of the higher induced thermal stresses, soaked samples showed a significant degradation of their tensile and shear strengths. Yet, the soaked material's stiffness remained largely unaffected due to the potential reversible nature of plasticization, which acts to increase the material's molecular mobility when initially moisture-saturated, but is later recovered as the soaked samples lose moisture throughout freeze-thaw cycling.

  CSV Title: Effect of economic recession and impact of health and social protection expenditures on adult mortality: a longitudinal analysis of 5565 Brazilian municipalities
  CSV Abstract: Background: Economic recession might worsen health in low-income and middle-income countries with precarious job markets and weak social protection systems. Between 2014–16, a major economic crisis occurred in Brazil. We aimed to assess the association between economic recession and adult mortality in Brazil and to ascertain whether health and social welfare programmes in the country had a protective effect against the negative impact of this recession. Methods: In this longitudinal analysis, we obtained data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health, the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics, the Ministry of Social Development and Fight Against Hunger, and the Information System for the Public Budget in Health to assess changes in state unemployment level and mortality among adults (aged ≥15 years) in Brazil between 2012 and 2017. Outcomes were municipal all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates for all adults and across population subgroups stratified by age, sex, and race. We used fixed-effect panel regression models with quarterly timepoints to assess the association between recession and changes in mortality. Mortality and unemployment rates were detrended using Hodrick–Prescott filters to assess cyclical variation and control for underlying trends. We tested interactions between unemployment and terciles of municipal social protection and health-care expenditure to assess whether the relationship between unemployment and mortality varied. Findings: Between 2012 and 2017, 7 069 242 deaths were recorded among adults (aged ≥15 years) in 5565 municipalities in Brazil. During this time period, the mean crude municipal adult mortality rate increased by 8·0% from 143·1 deaths per 100 000 in 2012 to 154·5 deaths per 100 000 in 2017. An increase in unemployment rate of 1 percentage-point was associated with a 0·50 increase per 100 000 population per rter (95% CI 0·09–0·91) in all-cause mortality, mainly due to cancer and cardiovascular disease. Between 2012 and 2017, higher unemployment accounted for 31 415 excess deaths (95% CI 29 698–33 132). All-cause mortality increased among black or mixed race (pardo) Brazilians (a 0·46 increase [95% CI 0·15–0·80]), men (0·67 [0·22–1·13]), and individuals aged 30–59 years (0·43 [0·16–0·69] per 1 percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate. No significant association was identified between unemployment and all-cause mortality for white Brazilian, women, adolescents (aged 15–29 years), or older and retired individuals (aged ≥60 years). In municipalities with high expenditure on health and social protection programmes, no significant increases in recession-related mortality were observed. Interpretation: The Brazilian recession contributed to increases in mortality. However, health and social protection expenditure seemed to mitigate detrimental health effects, especially among vulnerable populations. This evidence provides support for stronger health and social protection systems globally. Funding: None.

  CSV Title: A cognitive framework for the categorisation of auditory objects in urban soundscapes
  CSV Abstract: Categorisation is a fundamental cognitive process that plays a central role in everyday behaviour and action. Whereas previous studies have investigated the categorisation of isolated everyday sounds, this paper presents an experiment to investigate the cognitive categorisation of everyday sounds within their original context. A group of eighteen expert and non-expert listeners took part in a free sorting task using 110 sounds identified within ambisonic reproductions of urban soundscapes. The participants were asked to sort the objects into groups of sounds that served a similar purpose in the overall perception of the soundscape. Following this, the participants were asked to provide descriptive labels for the groups they had formed. The results were analysed using hierarchical agglomerative clustering and non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) to explore both the structure and dimensionality of the data. The resulting hierarchical clustering of objects show three top level categories relating to transient sounds, continuous sounds, and speech and vocalisations. Sub-categories were identified in each of the top level categories which included harmonic and non-harmonic continuous sounds, clear speech, unintelligible speech, vocalisations, transient sounds that indicate actions, and non-salient transient sounds. The first two dimensions revealed by the MDS analysis relate to temporal extent and intelligibility respectively. Interpretation of the third dimension is less clear, but may be related to harmonic content.

  CSV Title: Optimising the community-based approach to healthcare improvement: Comparative case studies of the clinical community model in practice
  CSV Abstract: Community-based approaches to healthcare improvement are receiving increasing attention. Such approaches could offer an infrastructure for efficient knowledge-sharing and a potent means of influencing behaviours, but their potential is yet to be optimised. After briefly reviewing challenges to community-based approaches, we describe in detail the clinical community model. Through exploring clinical communities in practice, we seek to identify practical lessons for optimising this community-based approach to healthcare improvement. Through comparative case studies based on secondary analysis, we examine two contrasting examples of clinical communities in practice – the USA-based Michigan Keystone ICU programme, and the UK-based Improving Lung Cancer Outcomes Project. We focus on three main issues. First, both cases were successful in mobilising diverse communities: favourable starting conditions, core teams with personal credibility, reputable institutional backing and embeddedness in wider networks were important. Second, top-down input to organise regular meetings, minimise conflict and empower those at risk of marginalisation helped establish a strong sense of community and reciprocal ties, while intervention components and measures common to the whole community strengthened peer-norming effects. Third, to drive implementation, technical expertise and responsiveness from the core team were important, but so too were ‘hard tactics’ (e.g. strict limits on local customisation); these were more easily deployed where the intervention was standardised across the community and a strong evidence-base existed. Contrary to the idea of self-organising communities, our cases make clear that vertical and horizontal forces depend on each other synergistically for their effectiveness. We offer practical lessons for establishing an effective balance of horizontal and vertical influences, and for identifying the types of quality problems most amenable to community-based improvement.

  CSV Title: An aircraft performance model implementation for the estimation of global and regional commercial aviation fuel burn and emissions
  CSV Abstract: Estimates of global aviation fuel burn and emissions are currently nearly 10years out of date. Here, the development of the Aircraft Performance Model Implementation (APMI) software which is used to update global commercial aviation fuel burn and emissions estimates is described. The results from APMI are compared with published estimates obtained using the US Federal Aviation Administration's System for Assessing Aviation's Global Emissions (SAGE) for the year 2006. The number of global departures modelled with the APMI software is 8% lower compared with SAGE and reflects the difference between their commercial air traffic statistics data sources. The mission fuel burn, CO2 and H2O estimates from APMI are approximately 20% lower than those predicted by SAGE for 2006 while the estimate for the total global aircraft SOx emissions is approximately 40% lower. The estimates for the emissions of CO, HC and NOx are 10%, 140% and 30% higher than those predicted by SAGE respectively. The reasons for these differences are discussed in detail.

  CSV Title: Hydrodynamic constraints on the evolution and ecology of planktic foraminifera
  CSV Abstract: The origin and function of a biomineralised skeleton in many of the non-motile groups of plankton remains an open question. Morphological diversity within these groups has often been explained by its relevance to hydrodynamic behaviour, principally buoyancy and settling. Consequently, ecological and evolutionary patterns of morphology have been associated with changes in surface water properties, but these hypotheses have rarely been critically assessed. Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations present a way to quantify the relative effect of size (maximum diameter), shape of the test and density (ratio between calcite and cavity volumes) of the specimen on settling velocity, as all variables can be manipulated independently. Here we interrogate the morphological diversity in planktic foraminifera as model organisms to explore the range of evolutionary options open to plankton to modulate settling velocity under varying environmental conditions. The evolutionary changes in morphology required to accommodate physical changes in the upper water column due to environmental changes, such as increased temperature, are small compared to the ecophenotypic variability of the population. In the modern ocean, the pattern of species distribution with depth is not likely to be determined by hydrodynamics as it is inconsistent with predictions based on settling velocity. These results suggest that intrinsic constraints on size, shape and calcification, such as heritage, exposure of the symbionts to light or oxygen diffusion into the cell, are likely to be more important than hydrodynamic function in determining the depth distribution and test morphology of planktic foraminifera. © 2014 The Authors.

  CSV Title: Developmental changes of GABA immunoreactivity in cortico-thalamic networks of an absence seizure model
  CSV Abstract: Absence seizures (ASs) are associated with abnormalities in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission in the thalamus and the cortex. In the present study, we used light microscopy GABA immunocytochemistry to quantify the GABA-immunoreactive (GABA-IR) neurons and neuropil in the thalamic ventral basal (VB) nucleus, the nucleus reticularis thalami (NRT), the dorsal lateral geniculate (dLGN), the primary motor cortex (M1) and perioral region of the somatosensory cortex (S1po) of genetic absence epilepsy rats from Strasbourg (GAERS). We used both the relative non-epileptic control (NEC) and normal Wistar rats as control strains, and investigated GABA immunostaining at postnatal day 15 (P15), P25, and P90. The main findings were i) an increase in GABA-IR neuropil in the VB at P25 and P90 in GAERS but not in NEC and Wistar rats; ii) an increase in NRT GABA-IR neurons in GAERS and NEC, but not Wistar, rats at both P25 and P90; and iii) an increase in GABA-IR neuron density in S1po of GAERS at P25 and P90 and in Wistar at P90. These results indicate that the increased GABAergic innervation in the VB at P25 most likely contributes to the enhanced tonic inhibition observed in GAERS prior to AS onset, whereas the lack of any anatomo-morphological GABAergic differences in GAERS S1po suggests that functional more than structural abnormalities underlie the origin of cortical paroxysms in S1po of this AS model.

  CSV Title: Synchronized drowsiness monitoring and simulated driving performance data under 50-hr sleep deprivation: A double-blind placebo-controlled caffeine intervention
  CSV Abstract: This paper presents the 60-s time-resolution segment from our 50-h total sleep deprivation (TSD) dataset (Aidman et al., 2018) [1] that captures minute-by-minute dynamics of driving performance (lane keeping and speed variability) along with objective, oculography-derived drowsiness estimates synchronised to the same 1-min driving epochs. Eleven participants (5 females, aged 18–28) were randomised into caffeine (administered in four 200 mg doses via chewing gum in the early morning hours) or placebo groups. Every three hours they performed a 40 min simulated drive in a medium fidelity driving simulator, while their drowsiness was continuously measured with a spectacle frame-mounted infra-red alertness monitoring system. The dataset covers 15 driving periods of 40 min each, and thus contains over 600 data points of paired data per participant. The 1-min time resolution enables detailed time-series analyses of both time-since-wake and time-on-task performance dynamics and associated drowsiness levels. It also enables direct examination of the relationships between drowsiness and task performance measures. The question of how these relationships might change under various intervention conditions (caffeine in our case) seems worth further investigation.

  CSV Title: Biobanks for life sciences and personalized medicine: importance of standardization, biosafety, biosecurity, and data management
  CSV Abstract: Biological samples such as tissues, blood and other body fluids, plants or seeds, prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells or isolated biomolecules as well as associated data are the essential raw material for research and development in medicine, biotechnology and agriculture. The collection, processing, preservation, and storage of these resources, in addition to provision of access, are key activities of biobanks or biological resource centres. Biobanks have to ensure proper quality of samples and data, ethical and legal compliance as well as transparent and efficient access procedures. In this context the review places special emphasis on pre-analytical procedures and international standards, which are essential to improving analytical data reliability and reproducibility, as well as on the increasing importance of data management. These requirements of biobanks are demonstrated using the example of pathogen-containing and microbiome biobanks, and refer to needs in cancer research and development.

  CSV Title: The inflammatory chemokine Cxcl18b exerts neutrophil-specific chemotaxis via the promiscuous chemokine receptor Cxcr2 in zebrafish
  CSV Abstract: Cxcl18b is a chemokine found in zebrafish and in other piscine and amphibian species. Cxcl18b is a reliable inflammatory marker; however, its function is yet to be elucidated. Here, we found that Cxcl18b is chemotactic towards neutrophils, similarly to Cxcl8a/Interleukin-8, the best characterised neutrophil chemoattractant in humans and teleosts. Like Cxcl8a, Cxcl18b-dependent recruitment required the chemokine receptor Cxcr2, while it was unaffected by depletion of the other two neutrophil receptors cxcr1 and cxcr4b. To visualise cxcl18b induction, we generated a Tg(cxcl18b:eGFP) reporter line. The transgene is induced locally upon bacterial infection with the fish pathogen Mycobacterium marinum, but strikingly is not directly expressed by infected cells. Instead, cxcl18b is induced by non-phagocytic uninfected cells that compose the stroma of the granulomas, typical inflammatory lesions formed upon mycobacterial infections. Together, these results suggest that Cxcl18b might be an important contributor to neutrophil chemotaxis in the inflammatory microenvironment and indicate that the zebrafish model could be explored to further investigate in vivo the biological relevance of different Cxcl8-like chemokine lineages.

  CSV Title: A search for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons over the Martian South Polar Residual Cap
  CSV Abstract: We present our research on compositional mapping of the Martian South Polar Residual Cap (SPRC), especially the detection of organic signatures within the dust content of the ice, based on hyperspectral data analysis. The SPRC is the main region of interest for this investigation, because of the unique CO2 ice sublimation features that cover the surface. These flat floored, circular depressions are highly dynamic, and we infer frequently expose dust particles previously trapped within the ice during the wintertime. Here we identify suitable regions for potential dust exposure on the SPRC, and utilise data from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) on board NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) satellite to examine infrared spectra of dark regions assumed to be composed mainly of dust particles to establish their mineral composition, to eliminate the effects of ices on sub-pixel dusty features, and to look for signatures indicative of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs). Spectral mapping has identified compositional differences between depression rims and the majority of the SPRC and CRISM spectra have been corrected to minimise the influence of CO2 ice. Whilst no conclusive evidence for PAHs has been found within the detectability limits of the CRISM instrument, depression rims are shown to have higher water content than regions of featureless ice, and there are possible indications of magnesium carbonate within the dark, dusty regions.

  CSV Title: Comparison of monoamine oxidase inhibition by cigarettes and modified risk tobacco products
  CSV Abstract: The adverse effects of cigarette smoking are well documented, and the two main strategies for reducing smoking prevalence are prevention of smoking initiation and promotion of smoking cessation. More recently, a third and complementary avenue, tobacco harm reduction has emerged, which is aimed to reduce the burden of smoking-related diseases. This has been enabled by the development of novel products such as electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and heated tobacco products, designed to deliver nicotine with significantly reduced levels of the toxicants that are emitted by cigarettes. Several potential modified risk tobacco products (pMRTP) have been reported to emit significantly less toxicants than cigarettes and significantly reduce toxicant exposure in smokers who switch completely to such products. These are two prerequisites for pMRTPs to reduce harm and the risk of smoking-related disease. However, concerns remain regarding the addictive nature of these products. Smoking addiction is a complex phenomenon involving multiple pharmacological and non-pharmacological factors. Although the main pharmacological substance associated with smoking addiction is nicotine, accumulating evidence suggests that nicotine mostly acts as a primary reinforcer and that other factors are involved in establishing smoking addiction. Inhibition of monoamine oxidases (MAO)—mammalian flavoenzymes with a central role in neurotransmitter metabolism—has also been suggested to be involved in this process. Therefore, we aimed to comparatively investigate the ability of several types of pMRTPs and cigarette smoke (3R4F) to inhibit MAO activity. The results showed that the heated tobacco product Tobacco Heating System (THS) 2.2 and the MESH 1.1 e-cigarette possessed no MAO inhibitory activity while 3R4F significantly inhibits the levels of MAO activity (3R4F MAO-A and B; > 2 μM nicotine). Snus products have similar inhibition profiles as 3R4F but for larger nicotine concentrations (snus MAO-A; ∼68-fold, snus MAO-B; ∼23-fold higher compared to 3R4F). These observations were confirmed by analytical datasets of potential MAO inhibitors emitted by these products. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that specific pMRTPs, namely THS 2.2 and MESH 1.1, have a significantly lower MAO-inhibitory activity than 3R4F. These findings provide a basis for further investigation of the role of MAO inhibitors in cigarette addiction as well as the implications of the findings for abuse liability of pMRTPs in comparison with cigarettes.

  CSV Title: Mitigating the effect of persistent postnatal depression on child outcomes through an intervention to treat depression and improve parenting: a randomised controlled trial
  CSV Abstract: Background: Maternal postnatal depression occurs following 10–15% of births and is associated with a range of negative child outcomes. Risks to children are particularly increased when postnatal depression is persistent. We aimed to examine whether a parenting video-feedback therapy (VFT) intervention versus a control treatment of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR), both added to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for persistent postnatal depression, would lead to improved child outcomes at age 2 years. Methods: In this two-arm, parallel-design, individually randomised controlled trial, we recruited a community sample of women aged 18 years or older living within 50 miles of Oxford, UK, between 4·5 and 9·0 months post partum. All participants met diagnostic criteria for current major depressive disorder that had persisted for at least 3 months and had infants at 35 or more weeks of gestation, with a birthweight of 2000 g or greater, and without serious neonatal complications. Through a centralised service, women were randomly assigned by use of a minimisation algorithm, to receive either VFT or PMR, balanced for child sex, temperament, age, socioeconomic status, and severity of depression. Both groups also received CBT for depression. Primary outcomes were child cognitive development, language development, behaviour problems, and attachment security at age 2 years. There were 11 home-based treatment sessions before child age 1 year, followed by two booster sessions in the second year. Assessors were masked to treatment group allocation. All analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN07336477. Findings: Between March 18, 2011, and Dec 9, 2013, we randomly assigned 144 women, 72 to each group. Primary outcome data were available for 62–64 (86–89%) VFT and 67–68 (93–94%) PMR participants. There were no group differences in child outcome (cognitive development, adjusted difference −1·01 [95% CI −5·11 to 3·09], p=0·63; language development, 1·33 [–4·16 to 6·82], p=0·63; behaviour problems, −1·77 [–4·39 to 0·85], p=0·19; attachment security, 0·02 [–0·06 to 0·10], p=0·58), with both groups achieving scores similar to non-clinical norms on all outcomes. There were six serious adverse events: five in the VFT group (in two participants) and one in the PMR group. None was treatment-related. Interpretation: The effect of persistent postnatal depression on children is a major public health issue. For both treatment groups there was sustained remission from depression, and child development outcomes were in the normal range. The precise mechanisms accounting for the observed positive child outcomes cannot be ascertained from this study. Funding: Wellcome Trust.

  CSV Title: Mitochondrial impairment activates the Wallerian pathway through depletion of NMNAT2 leading to SARM1-dependent axon degeneration
  CSV Abstract: Wallerian degeneration of physically injured axons involves a well-defined molecular pathway linking loss of axonal survival factor NMNAT2 to activation of pro-degenerative protein SARM1. Manipulating the pathway through these proteins led to the identification of non-axotomy insults causing axon degeneration by a Wallerian-like mechanism, including several involving mitochondrial impairment. Mitochondrial dysfunction is heavily implicated in Parkinson's disease, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, hereditary spastic paraplegia and other axonal disorders. However, whether and how mitochondrial impairment activates Wallerian degeneration has remained unclear. Here, we show that disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential leads to axonal NMNAT2 depletion in mouse sympathetic neurons, increasing the substrate-to-product ratio (NMN/NAD) of this NAD-synthesising enzyme, a metabolic fingerprint of Wallerian degeneration. The mechanism appears to involve both impaired NMNAT2 synthesis and reduced axonal transport. Expression of WLDS and Sarm1 deletion both protect axons after mitochondrial uncoupling. Blocking the pathway also confers neuroprotection and increases the lifespan of flies with Pink1 loss-of-function mutation, which causes severe mitochondrial defects. These data indicate that mitochondrial impairment replicates all the major steps of Wallerian degeneration, placing it upstream of NMNAT2 loss, with the potential to contribute to axon pathology in mitochondrial disorders.

  CSV Title: Worldwide perspectives on venom allergy
  CSV Abstract: Venom immunotherapy is the standard of care for people with severe reactions and has been proven to reduce risk of future anaphylactic events. There is a moral imperative to ensure production, supply and worldwide availability of locally relevant, registered, standardized commercial venom extracts for diagnosis and treatment. Insects causing severe immediate allergic reactions vary by region worldwide. The most common culprits include honeybees (Apis mellifera), social wasps including yellow jackets (Vespula and Dolichovespula), paper wasps (Polistes) and hornets (Vespa), stinging ants (Solenopsis, Myrmecia, Pachycondyla, and Pogonomyrmex), and bumblebees (Bombus). Insects with importance in specific areas of the world include the Australian tick (Ixodes holocyclus), the kissing bug (Triatoma spp), horseflies (Tabanus spp), and mosquitoes (Aedes, Culex, Anopheles). Reliable access to high quality venom immunotherapy to locally relevant allergens is not available throughout the world. Many current commercially available therapeutic vaccines have deficiencies, are not suitable for, or are unavailable in vast areas of the globe. New products are required to replace products that are unstandardized or inadequate, particularly whole-body extract products. New products are required for insects in which no current treatment options exist. Venom immunotherapy should be promoted throughout the world and the provision thereof be supported by health authorities, regulatory authorities and all sectors of the health care service.

A “currants-in-jelly” model is developed that provides a flexible approach in which the contribution of the soft high-level objects (jelly-like) are employed to protect the underlying atomic structure (currants), while still allowing them to interact. Idealised chains were used to establish the parameters to achieve this degree of interaction over a hierarchy spanning four levels and in a more realistic example, the distortion experienced by a protein domain structure during collision was measured and the parameters refined. This model of steric repulsion was then combined with sets of predicted distance constraints, derived from correlated mutation analysis. Firstly, an integral trans-membrane protein was modelled in which the packing of the seven helices was refined but without topological rearrangement. Secondly, an RNA structure was ‘folded’ under the predicted constraints, starting only from its 2-dimensional secondary structure prediction.

  CSV Title: Field-specific nutrient management using Rice Crop Manager decision support tool in Odisha, India
  CSV Abstract: The requirement of rice (Oryza sativa L.) for fertilizer can depend on crop and soil management practices, which can vary among fields within a rice-growing area. A web-based decision support tool named Rice Crop Manager (RCM) was developed previously to calculate field-specific rates of fertilizer N, P, and K for rice in Odisha State in eastern India. We compared field-specific nutrient management calculated by RCM with farmers’ fertilizer practice (FFP) and a blanket fertilizer recommendation (BFR), which used a uniform 80 kg N ha–1, 17 kg P ha–1, and 33 kg K ha–1. A total of 209 field trials were conducted in two seasons (kharif and rabi) for two years across ten districts in six agro-climatic zones. Grain yield was consistently higher with fertilization recommended by RCM than with FFP. Higher yield with RCM was attributed to a combination of applying more of the total fertilizer N at the critical growth stage of panicle initiation, applying more fertilizer N in kharif, and applying zinc. The RCM recommendation frequently increased yield compared to BFR as a result of improved N management, which included the adjustment of N rate for a target yield set slightly higher than historical yield reported by a farmer. Fertilization based on RCM rather than BFR reduced the risk of financial loss. The effectiveness of an RCM recommendation relative to BFR and FFP was consistent across rice varieties with different growth duration, irrigated and rainfed rice, and three categories of soil clay content. The RCM recommendation failed to increase yield relative to BFR in one of the six agro-climatic zones, where a higher rate of fertilizer P and/or K was apparently required. The nutrient management calculations used by RCM can be improved as new information and research findings become available. Experiences with RCM in Odisha can help guide the development of comparable nutrient management decision tools in other rice-growing areas.

  CSV Title: Mutations in a conserved loop in the PSST subunit of respiratory complex I affect ubiquinone binding and dynamics
  CSV Abstract: Respiratory complex I catalyses the reduction of ubiquinone (Q) from NADH coupled to proton pumping across the inner membrane of mitochondria. The electrical charging of the inner mitochondrial membrane drives the synthesis of ATP, which is used to power biochemical reactions of the cell. The recent surge in structural data on complex I from bacteria and mitochondria have contributed to significant understanding of its molecular architecture. However, despite these accomplishments, the role of various subdomains in redox-coupled proton pumping remains entirely unclear. In this work, we have mutated conserved residues in the loop of the PSST subunit that faces the ~30 Å long unique Q-binding tunnel of respiratory complex I. The data show a drastic decrease in Q reductase activity upon mutating several residues despite full assembly of the complex. In-silico modeling and multiple microsecond long molecular dynamics simulations of wild-type and enzyme variants with exchanges of conserved arginine residues revealed remarkable ejection of the bound Q from the site near terminal electron donor N2. Based on experiments and long-time scale molecular simulations, we identify microscopic elements that dynamically control the diffusion of Q and are central to redox-coupled proton pumping in respiratory complex I.

  CSV Title: Fifteen operationally important decisions in the planning of biodiversity offsets
  CSV Abstract: Many development projects, whether they are about construction of factories, mines, roads, railways, new suburbs, shopping malls, or even individual houses, have negative environmental consequences. Biodiversity offsetting is about compensating that damage, typically via habitat restoration, land management, or by establishment of new protected areas. Offsets are the fourth step of the so-called mitigation hierarchy, in which ecological damage is first avoided, minimized second, and third restored locally. Whatever residual damage remains is then offset. Offsetting has been increasingly adopted all around the world, but simultaneously serious concerns are expressed about the validity of the approach. Failure of offsetting can follow from either inappropriate definition of the size and kind of offset, or, from failure in implementation. Here we address planning of offsets, and identify fundamental operational design decisions that define the intended outcome of an offsetting project, and organize these decisions around objectives, offset actions, and the three fundamental ecological axes of ecological reality: space, time and biodiversity. We also describe how the offset ratio of a project (size of offset areas compared to impact area) can be constructed based on several partial multipliers that arise from factors such as degree of compensation required relative to no net loss, partial and delayed nature of restoration or avoided loss gains, time discounting, additionality, leakage, uncertainty, and factors associated with biodiversity measurement and offset implementation. Several of these factors are partially subjective and thus negotiable. The overall purpose of this effort is to allow systematic, well informed and transparent discussion about these critical decisions in any offset project.

  CSV Title: Identification of emergent blaCMY-2-carrying Proteus mirabilis lineages by whole-genome sequencing
  CSV Abstract: Whole-genome sequencing of 24 Proteus mirabilis isolates revealed the clonal expansion of two cefoxitin-resistant strains among patients with community-onset infection. These strains harboured blaCMY-2 within a chromosomally located integrative and conjugative element and exhibited multidrug resistance phenotypes. A predominant strain, identified in 18 patients, also harboured the PGI-1 genomic island and associated resistance genes, accounting for its broader antibiotic resistance profile. The identification of these novel multidrug-resistant strains among community-onset infections suggests that they are endemic to this region and represent emergent P. mirabilis lineages of clinical significance.

  CSV Title: Combining on-farm and climate data for risk management of nitrogen decisions
  CSV Abstract: Historical climate data are underutilized in agricultural decision making. We illustrate how long-term climate data and observations from farmers’ fields can be combined to quantify risks from seasonal weather and climate variability for nitrogen fertilizer management for corn (Zea mays L.). We developed a probability model for estimating the risk of deficient corn nitrogen status using within-field late-season plant measurements, field information about previous crop, nitrogen rate, form and application timing in combination with rainfall data. Using three grower risk attitudes (risk-tolerant, risk-neutral, risk-averse) we demonstrate the use of deficient corn nitrogen status probability values for making decisions about nitrogen logistics prior to and within the growing seasons and multi-year investments in more efficient and less risky fertilizer management practices. We find these probabilities could enable growers to explore alternative management scenarios (rates, timing and fertilizer forms) for in-season nitrogen management for each risk attitudes. We conclude that annual surveys of corn nitrogen status across Iowa should be useful not only for field-level logistic decisions but also new in-season weather-based plant status monitoring strategies and tools for evaluating business risk from past weather trends or anticipated changes in weather. While developed for the Midwest United States, the use of annual surveys and on-farm data to translate historical climate data can be implemented in any growing region.

  CSV Title: Modelling drug release from polymer-free coronary stents with microporous surfaces
  CSV Abstract: Traditional coronary drug-eluting stents (DES) are made from metal and are coated with a permanent polymer film containing an anti-proliferative drug. Subsequent to stent deployment in a diseased coronary artery, the drug releases into the artery wall and helps prevent restenosis by inhibiting the proliferation of smooth muscle cells. Although this technology has proven to be remarkably successful, there are ongoing concerns that the presence of a polymer in the artery can lead to deleterious medical complications, such as late stent thrombosis. Polymer-free DES may help overcome such shortcomings. However, the absence of a rate-controlling polymer layer makes optimisation of the drug release profile a particular challenge. The use of microporous stent surfaces to modulate the drug release rate is an approach that has recently shown particularly promising clinical results. In this study, we develop a mathematical model to describe drug release from such stents. In particular, we develop a mathematical model to describe drug release from microporous surfaces. The model predicts a two-stage release profile, with a relatively rapid initial release of most of the drug, followed by a slower release of the remaining drug. In the model, the slow release phase is accounted for by an adsorption/desorption mechanism close to the stent surface. The theoretical predictions are compared with experimental release data obtained in our laboratory, and good agreement is found. The valuable insights provided by our model will serve as a useful guide for designing the enhanced polymer-free stents of the future.

  CSV Title: Prion-like seeding and nucleation of intracellular amyloid-β
  CSV Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain tissue can act as a seed to accelerate aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) into plaques in AD transgenic mice. Aβ seeds have been hypothesized to accelerate plaque formation in a prion-like manner of templated seeding and intercellular propagation. However, the structure(s) and location(s) of the Aβ seeds remain unknown. Moreover, in contrast to tau and α-synuclein, an in vitro system with prion-like Aβ has not been reported. Here we treat human APP expressing N2a cells with AD transgenic mouse brain extracts to induce inclusions of Aβ in a subset of cells. We isolate cells with induced Aβ inclusions and using immunocytochemistry, western blot and infrared spectroscopy show that these cells produce oligomeric Aβ over multiple replicative generations. Further, we demonstrate that cell lysates of clones with induced oligomeric Aβ can induce aggregation in previously untreated N2a APP cells. These data strengthen the case that Aβ acts as a prion-like protein, demonstrate that Aβ seeds can be intracellular oligomers and for the first time provide a cellular model of nucleated seeding of Aβ.

  CSV Title: HCV evolutionary genetics of SVR versus virologic failure assessed from the vaniprevir phase III registration trials
  CSV Abstract: In the phase III registration studies conducted in Japan, Japanese HCV gt1 patients administered vaniprevir 300 mg twice daily plus pegylated interferon/ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks achieved SVR24 rates of 83.7-84.5% among treatment-naïve patients, and 92.0-96.2% and 61.9% among breakthrough/relapsers or null-responders to prior interferon based therapy. As evidenced by direct sequencing, patients who did not achieve SVR24 principally failed due to treatment-emerging mutations at D168 or in a few cases R155. In this work, additional sequence analysis was conducted to address whether there were baseline polymorphisms associated with failure, evaluate the persistence of resistant virus among treatment failures, and assess for evidence of second site co-evolution with R155 or D168 mutations. To accomplish this, clonal sequencing (up to 40 clones per sample) was conducted on baseline, failure, and follow-up samples from all 38 patients among the vaniprevir treatment arms who met virologic failure criteria (37 gt1b, 1 gt1a, herein referred to as virologic failures) and baseline samples from 41 vaniprevir-treated SVR24 patients (all gt1b) selected among the three studies. SVR24 and virologic failure patients showed similar distributions of baseline polymorphisms previously associated with failure to one or more protease inhibitors. Furthermore, there was no evidence for baseline polymorphisms or a genetic signature across the NS3 protease domain specific to virologic failure patients, and which distinguishes them from baseline SVR24 sequences beyond a chance distribution. 24 of 32 virologic failures for whom baseline, failure, and follow-up samples were available showed reduced prevalence of the resistant virus first observed at the time of failure during the protocol-defined follow-up period of 24 weeks. Finally, pairwise analysis using either alignment or phylogenetic based methodologies provided no evidence for second site evolution with either the R155 or D168 mutations attributed to failure. This work supports and extends earlier findings based upon direct sequencing that attributed virologic failure to vaniprevir in the Phase III studies solely to the emergence of R155 or D168 mutations, with no apparent influence by other residues within the NS3 protease domain on treatment outcome.

  CSV Title: Stimulating urban transition and transformation to achieve sustainable and resilient cities
  CSV Abstract: Political decision-makers need to consider the various challenges and opportunities that climate change can bring, and they must take decisions under high uncertainty to achieve resilient cities. Here, we synthesise the push and pull approaches reported in the literature and employed in practice to achieve sustainable and resilient cities. First, we present a literature review which identified the major research fields on transition theories, frameworks and methods that underpin this concept. We analyse the conditions for change, identify enablers or triggers for change at governance level for transitioning a city towards sustainability and resilience. We discuss the theories, frameworks and methods which can be used to address the urban climate change challenge at city level. Second, we present an empirical approach based on stakeholder participation that we conducted to detect the conditions for change. We report on the design and implementation of stakeholder exercises that helped us detecting the conditions for changes. Third, we combine the information obtained from these stakeholder exercises with that extracted from the literature in order to provide a fuller picture on how stimulate the transition and transformation to achieve sustainable and resilient cities. Based on our literature review and empirical approach, we formulate an integrated conceptual model for transition that enables the design of adaptation (and mitigation) strategies that consider the triggers of change. Uniquely we identified 8 triggers of change, including authority and political leadership, learning from disasters, co-responsibility, increased public-private interface, social participation and the living lab approach to innovation. The proposed model can be applied to the whole city or to a certain sector of the city (e.g. energy). We demonstrate that triggers of change help to overcome planning and implementation barriers and move the socio-ecological and socio-technical systems of any city towards those of a resilient city.

  CSV Title: The efficacy of good practice to prevent long-term leaching losses of phosphorus from an irrigated dairy farm
  CSV Abstract: Phosphorus (P) can be leached from intensive land uses, including grazed dairy farming. There is some evidence to suggest that P-leaching can enrich groundwater, especially where fertiliser or farm dairy effluent P (FDE) is applied to soils of low sorption capacity. We measured P fractions in leachate at 70 cm depth from two soils of low-P sorption capacity in an intensively grazed dairy farm, one a free-draining shallow soil and another a deep and moderately well-drained soil. As per industry good practice, the soils were maintained at an agronomic optimum and received P as either fertiliser or a lower rate of fertiliser plus FDE, applied according to regional rules and industry guidelines to avoid the FDE ponding on the soil surface and leaching to depth. Our hypothesis was that rules and guidelines were not sufficient to prevent P losses, especially in the free-draining soil. In response to annual applications of 40 kg P ha−1 yr−1 as fertiliser or 30 kg P ha−1 yr−1 as fertiliser and 10 kg P ha−1 yr−1 as FDE, dissolved and particulate P concentrations increased annually 4 to 7%. Mean total P load over the 14-yr period of measurement (2001–2015) from the FDE-treated, free-draining shallow soil was 1.46 kg ha−1 yr−1, much greater than the same soil without FDE (0.25 kg ha−1 yr−1) or the moderately well-drained soil with or without FDE applied (0.12 kg ha−1 yr−1, for both treatments). Leaching losses were attributed to a combination of high hydraulic conductivity enhanced by the presence of macropores and the increasing P saturation of macropore walls. An enrichment in dissolved reactive P was also detected in a well intercepting groundwater at 10-m depth. However, the source of the enrichment was unclear. These data suggest that despite following industry good practice, regional rules and industry guidelines significant P losses may occur when FDE is applied to soil at rates designed to maintain soil Olsen P in an agronomically optimal concentration. It is unclear if applying less FDE at lower rate, would decrease P losses. Therefore, less P must be applied, made less available for loss, or P-rich FDE not applied to this freely draining shallow stony soil (or similar soils) under irrigation.

  CSV Title: Data for interventional role of training in changing the knowledge and attitudes of urban mothers towards food hygiene (A case study of Ravansar Township, Kermanshah, Iran)
  CSV Abstract: Food hygiene is a key factor at the time of production and distribution of food. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the interventional role of education in changing the knowledge and attitudes of urbane mothers towards food hygiene in Ravansar Township, Kermanshah, Iran. To this end, 200 mothers residing in Ravansar Township were selected using simple random sampling. First, the subjects’ knowledge and attitudes towards food hygiene were evaluated in a pre-test, and then after holding some educational sessions, the two variables were assessed again in a post-test using a researcher-made questionnaire with 72 questions. The reliability and validity of the questionnaire were evaluated using Cronbach's alpha and content validity, respectively. After completing the questionnaires, the results were analyzed using the SPSS Statistical Software Version 21.0, and all tests were at the significance level of α = 0.05. The results of the present study demonstrated that education did not promote the knowledge of married subjects, those whose use of media was average or high, and the ones aged above 20 (P > 0.05). However, the results showed that education had significant effects on other factors (P < 0.05). In addition, it was revealed that the effects of education on promoting the attitudes of individuals aged above 60, those holding academic education and married subjects were not significant (P > 0.05), Nevertheless, the results revealed that education had significant effects on other factors (P < 0.05). Hence, it can be concluded that education plays a major role in changing the knowledge and attitudes of urban mothers towards food hygiene.

  CSV Title: Volumetric grey matter alterations in adolescents and adults born very preterm suggest accelerated brain maturation
  CSV Abstract: Previous research investigating structural neurodevelopmental alterations in individuals who were born very preterm demonstrated a complex pattern of grey matter changes that defy straightforward summary. Here we addressed this problem by characterising volumetric brain alterations in individuals who were born very preterm from adolescence to adulthood at three hierarchically related levels - global, modular and regional. We demarcated structural components that were either particularly resilient or vulnerable to the impact of very preterm birth. We showed that individuals who were born very preterm had smaller global grey matter volume compared to controls, with subcortical and medial temporal regions being particularly affected. Conversely, frontal and lateral parieto-temporal cortices were relatively resilient to the effects of very preterm birth, possibly indicating compensatory mechanisms. Exploratory analyses supported this hypothesis by showing a stronger association between lateral parieto-temporal volume and IQ in the very preterm group compared to controls. We then related these alterations to brain maturation processes. Very preterm individuals exhibited a higher maturation index compared to controls, indicating accelerated brain maturation and this was specifically associated with younger gestational age. We discuss how the findings of accelerated maturation might be reconciled with evidence of delayed maturation at earlier stages of development.

  CSV Title: Single trial beta oscillations index time estimation
  CSV Abstract: Recent work shows that putamen-originating beta power oscillations serve as a carrier for temporal information during tapping tasks, with higher beta power associated with longer temporal reproductions. However, given the nature of tapping tasks, it is difficult to determine whether beta power dynamics observed in these tasks are linked to the generation or execution of motor programs or to the internal representation of time. To assess whether recent findings in animals generalize to human studies we reanalyzed existing EEG data of participants who estimated a 2.5. s time interval with self-paced onset and offset keypresses. The results showed that the trial-to-trial beta power measured after the onset predicts the produced duration, such that higher beta power indexes longer produced durations. Moreover, although beta power measured before the first key-press also influenced the estimated interval, it did so independently from post-first-keypress beta power. These results suggest that initial motor inhibition plays an important role in interval production, and that this inhibition can be interpreted as a biased starting point of the decision processes involved in time estimation.

  CSV Title: Bquant – Novel script for batch quantification of LCMS data
  CSV Abstract: Quantitative target analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LCMS) is ubiquitous in environmental, metabolomic and toxicological studies. Targeted LCMS methods are capable of the simultaneous determination of literally hundreds of analytes. Although acquiring of instrumental data is very fast, data post-processing i.e. quantification can be time consuming step (and)or dependent to various commercial software packages. In attempt to facilitate this drawback Wolfram Mathematica script for batch quantification of LCMS data was created. Script works with direct outputs of integration algorithms created by different instrument control software's or custom created outputs. Key benefits of Bquant script are: • simple and automated routine for batch mode quantification• vast improvement in processing time (especially compared to manual interpretation)• data can be quickly re-analysed using different inputsScript was validated on various datasets and some of these were provided as working examples.

  CSV Title: A novel approach for Escherichia coli genome editing combining in vivo cloning and targeted long-length chromosomal insertion
  CSV Abstract: Despite the abundance of genetic manipulation approaches, particularly for Escherichia coli, new techniques and increased flexibility in the application of existing techniques are required to address novel aims. The most widely used approaches for chromosome editing are based on bacteriophage site-specific and λRed/RecET-mediated homologous recombination. In the present study, these techniques were combined to develop a novel approach for in vivo cloning and targeted long-length chromosomal insertion. This approach permits direct λRed-mediated cloning of DNA fragment with lengths of 10 kb or greater from the E. coli chromosome into the plasmid vector pGL2, which carries the ori of pSC101, the ϕ80-attP site of ϕ80 phage, and an excisable CmR marker bracketed by λ-attL/attR sites. In pGL2-based recombinant plasmids, the origin of replication can be eliminated in vitro via hydrolysis by SceI endonuclease and recircularization by DNA ligase. The resulting ori-less circular recombinant DNA can be used for targeted insertion of the cloned sequence into the chromosome at a selected site via ϕ80 phage-specific integrase-mediated recombination using the Dual-In/Out approach (Minaeva et al., 2008). At the final stage of chromosomal editing, the CmR-marker can be excised from the chromosome due to expression of the λint/xis genes. Notably, the desired fragment can be inserted as multiple copies in the chromosome by combining insertions at different sites in one strain using the P1 general transduction technique (Moore, 2011). The developed approach is useful for the construction of plasmidless, markerless recombinant strains for fundamental and industrial purposes.

  CSV Title: Concurrent AIV as a method to hard tailor test- and model philosophies in times of need
  CSV Abstract: MASCOT, a small 11 kg prototype Asteroid Lander on-board JAXA's Hayabusa2 space probe, was launched on December 3rd, 2014, and arrived at its destined target asteroid (162173) Ryugu on June 27, 2018. MASCOT was separated from its mother spacecraft and successfully landed on October 3rd, 2018, accomplishing the first ever landing of a European spacecraft on the surface of an asteroid. To catch this particular launch opportunity its development timeline needed to be heavily compressed. In particular, the kick-off for hardware production was released in February 2012, only 2 years before the initially planned delivery of the flight unit. Due to this compact schedule, current and well established verification processes could not be followed in order to finalize the project in the given time. But by applying a unique mix of conventional and tailored model philosophies it was possible to dynamical adapt the test program to accomplish for the shortest planning and a suitable weighing of costs and risks. A strategy of Concurrent Assembly, Integration and Verification (C-AIV) helped to identify and mitigate design and manufacturing issues and shortened the test timeline further from a general 4–5 year C/D-phase down to 2,5 year C/D-phase. This short article outlines the general idea of the applied method which could be used by AIV and System Engineers in a general tailoring process for projects of similar nature which could be run in an alternative and much faster way, if the circumstances would call for it. • Concurrent AIV, a new agile methodology to hard tailor test and model philosophies for space projects is presented, • The methodology is based on parallelization of test activities, creation of independent unique test threads and synergizing their dependencies at key points, • On the baseline of the asteroid lander MASCOT, this methodology has been successfully applied to shorten the overall test and implementation schedule to only 2.5 years.

  CSV Title: Dynamics in rail infrastructure provision: Maintenance and renewal costs in Sweden
  CSV Abstract: In this paper, we extend to the literature on marginal wear and tear cost estimation in railways, by applying a panel vector autoregressive model to rail infrastructure renewals and maintenance costs, using an extensive dataset from Sweden. This study is significant given the inherent difficulties in modelling the substantial renewals element of infrastructure costs, as well as the need to account for the dynamics in renewals and maintenance. The dynamic model allows us to estimate equilibrium cost elasticities with respect to train usage, which are significantly larger than their static counterparts. Overall, this work highlights that dynamics in rail infrastructure costs are important to consider when setting track access charges with respect to the wear and tear caused by traffic. This is particularly important given several countries, for example France, Sweden and Switzerland, are now setting access charges at marginal costs based on econometric studies.

  CSV Title: Re-programming immunosurveillance in persistent non-infectious ocular inflammation
  CSV Abstract: Ocular function depends on a high level of anatomical integrity. This is threatened by inflammation, which alters the local tissue over short and long time-scales. Uveitis due to autoimmune disease, especially when it involves the retina, leads to persistent changes in how the eye interacts with the immune system. The normal pattern of immune surveillance, which for immune privileged tissues is limited, is re-programmed. Many cell types, that are not usually present in the eye, become detectable. There are changes in the tissue homeostasis and integrity. In both human disease and mouse models, in the most extreme cases, immunopathological findings consistent with development of ectopic lymphoid-like structures and disrupted angiogenesis accompany severely impaired eye function. Understanding how the ocular environment is shaped by persistent inflammation is crucial to developing novel approaches to treatment.

  CSV Title: New species, combinations and range extensions in Hesperantha Ker Gawl. (Iridaceae: Crocoideae) from western South Africa
  CSV Abstract: The southern and tropical African genus Hesperantha, now with some 88 species, is distinguished in subfam. Crocoideae by the style dividing near or below the mouth of the perianth tube into relatively long style branches and, with a few exceptions, by woody corm tunics. We describe three new species from Northern Cape, South Africa discovered in September 2014. Hesperantha palustris (sect. Concentricae) from marshes at high elevation and Hesperantha filiformis (sect. Concentricae) from rocky sites, were both collected on the Hantamsberg. H. palustris is one of the tallest species in the genus, reaching up to 480. mm, with moderate-sized white flowers opening after dark. The diminutive H. filiformis, one of only a few species with just three leaves, has a perianth tube slightly longer than the spreading white tepals. The third new species, Hesperantha eremophila, has the flat-based corm of sect. Hesperantha and is restricted to the Vandersterrberg in the Richtersveld National Park. We also recognize Hesperantha falcata subsp. lutea for populations with yellow flowers opening during the day and closing in late afternoon. Typical plants of H. falcata have white flowers opening in the late afternoon. We also record two range extensions: an additional population of the Roggeveld Escarpment endemic, Hesperantha secunda, from the Keiskie Mtns SW of Calvinia; and high altitude populations of Hesperantha rivulicola from 1 380. m on the Hantamsberg, otherwise known from lower elevations near Nieuwoudtville and Calvinia (760-980. m).

  CSV Title: In vitro models of medulloblastoma: Choosing the right tool for the job
  CSV Abstract: The recently-defined four molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma have required updating of our understanding of in vitro models to include molecular classification and risk stratification features from clinical practice. This review seeks to build a more comprehensive picture of the in vitro systems available for modelling medulloblastoma. The subtype classification and molecular characterisation for over 40 medulloblastoma cell-lines has been compiled, making it possible to identify the strengths and weaknesses in current model systems. Less than half (18/44) of established medulloblastoma cell-lines have been subgrouped. The majority of the subgrouped cell-lines (11/18) are Group 3 with MYC-amplification. SHH cell-lines are the next most common (4/18), half of which exhibit TP53 mutation. WNT and Group 4 subgroups, accounting for 50% of patients, remain underrepresented with 1 and 2 cell-lines respectively. In vitro modelling relies not only on incorporating appropriate tumour cells, but also on using systems with the relevant tissue architecture and phenotype as well as normal tissues. Novel ways of improving the clinical relevance of in vitro models are reviewed, focusing on 3D cell culture, extracellular matrix, co-cultures with normal cells and organotypic slices. This paper champions the establishment of a collaborative online-database and linked cell-bank to catalyse preclinical medulloblastoma research.

  CSV Title: The role of re-aggregation on the performance of electrochemically exfoliated many-layer graphene for Li-ion batteries
  CSV Abstract: Two potential pathways for Li+ diffusion occur within graphitic carbon with typically in-plane diffusion dominating (∼10-7 cm2 s-1) over diffusion along the crystallite grain boundaries (∼10-11 cm2 s-1). Reducing the flake thickness of microcrystalline graphite powders via electrochemical exfoliation offers a method to overcome the latter, sluggish grain boundary Li+ diffusion, thereby increasing the overall rate capability of the graphite negative electrode in a the Li-ion battery. Six micron particulate graphite was electrochemically exfoliated to give flakes of which ∼90% had a thickness of <10 graphene layers. This exfoliated material was then prepared as an ink and allowed to dry prior to forming a battery electrode. Analysis of the electrode and dried exfoliated powder using powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller isotherm analysis show that the material has, apart from a significant reduction of the rhombohedral fraction from 41% to 14%, near-identical properties to that of original starting graphite powder. Thus, once the exfoliated powder has been dried from the exfoliation process, as anticipated, major restacking of the multi-layer graphene flakes had occurred. Likewise there was no significant improvement in using the exfoliated material at high rates of delithiation and lower specific capacity, when tested within a half cell vs. lithium metal. In situ Raman analysis showed that the exfoliated material displayed similar spectral features to the pristine sample during lithiation, as did multi point measurements on differently disordered areas shown from the varying ID/IG-band intensity ratios, indicating that local surface disorder does not influence the course of lithium insertion. The re-aggregation of graphenic material is widely recognised, but seldom evaluated. This work shows the importance of keeping graphenic material dispersed at all stages of production.

  CSV Title: Dissociable effects of the apolipoprotein-E (APOE) gene on short- and long-term memories
  CSV Abstract: Short- and long-term memory performance as a function of apolipoprotein-E (APOE) genotype was examined in older, healthy individuals using sensitive and comparable tasks to provide a more detailed description of influences of the ε4 allele (highest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease) on memory. Older heterozygous and homozygous ε4 carriers and noncarriers performed 2 tasks of memory. Both tasks allowed us to measure memory for item identity and locations, using a sensitive, continuous measure of report. Long-term memory for object locations was impaired in ε4/ε4 carriers, whereas, paradoxically, this group demonstrated superior short-term memory for locations. The dissociable effects of the gene on short- and long-term memory suggest that the effect of genotype on these two types of memories, and their neural underpinnings, might not be co-extensive. Whereas the long-term memory impairment might be linked to preclinical Alzheimer's disease, the short-term memory advantage may reflect an independent, phenotypical effect of this allele on cognition.

  CSV Title: Deuterium retention in tungsten under combined high cycle ELM-like heat loads and steady-state plasma exposure
  CSV Abstract: To investigate the synergistic effects of fuel retention in tungsten, experiments were performed in the linear plasma device PSI-2 where the transient heat loads were applied by a high energy laser during the steady-state plasma operation. The impact on the deuterium (D) retention of simultaneous and sequential exposures to laser and plasma has been investigated. A significant increase of D retention, more than a factor of 12, has been observed during the simultaneous transient heat loads and plasma exposure. Successive exposures to transient heat loads and deuterium plasma also show the increased content of D-atoms by more than a factor of 3.6 in comparison to the pure plasma loading. In both cases the increase is most likely due to enhanced hydrogen clustering by the thermal shock exposures, due to an increased mobility of D atoms along the shock-induced cracks as well as to increased diffusion of D atoms into the W material caused by strong temperature gradients during the laser pulse exposure. Comparison of the NRA and TDS measurements shows that only 34% of the retained deuterium in the tungsten specimen is located inside the near-surface layer (d < 4 µm) after simultaneous as well as sequential exposures of W to heat load. Enhanced blister formation has been observed under combined loading conditions at power densities close to the threshold for damaging. It is shown that blisters are not mainly responsible for the pronounced increase of the D retention.

  CSV Title: Cycling fatalities: When a helmet is useless and when it might save your life
  CSV Abstract: Autopsy reports of 119 cyclists who died in two Czech regions between 1995 and 2013 as a result of traffic crashes were studied. In all the study cases, pathologists analyzed whether a helmet could have helped the cyclists survive the crash or not. The crash circumstances from the police reports were then evaluated. The results indicate that helmets could have helped the most in cases of single-vehicle crashes when cyclists fell off their bicycles or hit obstacles and in certain cases when an intracranial injury was the primary cause of death. Altogether 44 cyclists (37%) from this study could have survived if they had been wearing helmets during the crashes. Helmets would not have helped cyclists in most high-energetic crashes, especially when motor-vehicles or trains were involved. Some rear-end crashes outside urban areas also resulted in injuries when a helmet would not have helped. This study concludes that cyclists should wear helmets, but they should also be aware that it cannot protect them in particular situations. These facts should be incorporated into safety campaigns to prevent cyclists from feeling protected in such situations when helmets cannot help. Our results also support the building of cycling paths separate from traffic, particularly outside of urban areas.

  CSV Title: Hippocampal information processing across sleep/wake cycles
  CSV Abstract: According to a two-stage memory consolidation model, during waking theta states, afferent activity from the neocortex to the hippocampus induces transient synaptic modification in the hippocampus, where the information is deposited as a labile form of memory trace. During subsequent sharp-wave ripples (SPW-Rs), the newly acquired hippocampal information is transferred to the neocortex and stored as a long-lasting memory trace. Consistent with this hypothesis, waking theta states and SPW-Rs distinctly control information flow in the hippocampal–entorhinal loop. Although both waking theta states and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep are characterized by prominent hippocampal theta oscillations, the two brain states involve distinct temporal coordination and oscillatory coupling in the hippocampal–entorhinal circuit. While distinct brain states have distinct network dynamics, firing rates of individual neurons in the hippocampal–entorhinal circuitry follow lognormal-like distributions in all states. Firing rates of the same neurons are positively correlated across brain states and testing environments, suggesting that memory is allocated in preconfigured, rather than tabula rasa-type, skewed neuronal networks. The fast-firing minority and slow-firing majority neurons, which can support network stability and flexibility, are under distinct homeostatic regulations that are initiated by spindles and SPW-Rs during slow wave sleep and implemented during subsequent REM sleep.

  CSV Title: Dataset of the binding kinetic rate constants of anti-PCSK9 antibodies obtained using the Biacore T100, ProteOn XPR36, Octet RED384, and IBIS MX96 biosensor platforms
  CSV Abstract: Here we provide data from a head-to-head comparison study using four biosensor platforms: GE Healthcare׳s Biacore T100, Bio-Rad׳s ProteOn XPR36, ForteBio׳s Octet RED384, and Wasatch Microfluidics׳s IBIS MX96. We used these instruments to analyze the binding interactions of a panel of ten high-affinity monoclonal antibodies with their antigen, human proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9). For each instrument, binding curves obtained at multiple densities of surface antibodies were fit to the 1:1 Langmuir kinetic model, and the association and dissociation rate constants and corresponding affinity constants were calculated. The data supplied in this article accompany the research article entitled, “Comparison of biosensor platforms in the evaluation of high affinity antibody–antigen binding kinetics” (Yang et al., 2016) [1], which further discusses the strengths and weaknesses of each biosensor platform with an emphasis on data consistency, comparability, and operational efficiency.

  CSV Title:  Techno-economic assessment of CO 2 direct air capture plants 
  CSV Abstract:  CO 2 direct air capture (DAC) has been increasingly discussed as a climate change mitigation option. Despite technical advances in the past decade, there are still misconceptions about DAC's current and long-term costs as well as energy, water and area demands. This could undermine DAC's anticipated role in a neutral or negative greenhouse gas emission energy system, and influence policy makers. In this study, a literature review and techno-economic analyses of state-of-the-art DAC technologies are performed, wherein, DAC technologies are categorised as high temperature aqueous solutions (HT DAC) and low temperature solid sorbent (LT DAC) systems, from an energy system perspective. DAC capital expenditures, energy demands and costs have been estimated under two scenarios for DAC capacities and financial learning rates in the period 2020 to 2050. DAC system costs could be lowered significantly with commercialisation in the 2020s followed by massive implementation in the 2040s and 2050s, making them cost competitive with point source carbon capture and an affordable climate change mitigation solution. It is concluded that LT DAC systems are favourable due to lower heat supply costs and the possibility of using waste heat from other systems. CO 2 capture costs of LT DAC systems powered by hybrid PV-Wind-battery systems for Moroccan conditions and based on a conservative scenario, without/with utilisation of free waste heat are calculated at 222/133, 105/60, 69/40 and 54/32 €/t CO2 in 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050, respectively. These new findings could enhance DAC's role in a successful climate change mitigation strategy.

  CSV Title: Vestibular implant: does it really work? A systematic review
  CSV Abstract: Introduction: People with vestibular loss present a deficit in the vestibular system, which is primarily responsible for promoting postural control, gaze stabilization, and spatial orientation while the head moves. There is no effective treatment for a bilateral loss of vestibular function. Recently, a vestibular implant was developed for people with bilateral loss of vestibular function to improve this function and, consequently, the quality of life of these patients. Objective: To identify in the scientific literature evidence that vestibular implants in people with vestibular deficit improves vestibular function. Methods: One hundred and forty six articles were found from five databases and 323 articles from the gray literature mentioning the relationship between vestibular implant and vestibular function in humans. The PICOS strategy (Population, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome) was used to define the eligibility criteria. The studies that met the inclusion criteria for this second step were included in a qualitative synthesis, and each type of study was analyzed according to the bias risk assessment of the Joanna Briggs Institute through the critical assessment checklist Joanna Briggs institute for quasi-experimental studies and the Joanna Briggs institute critical assessment checklist for case reports. Results: Of the 21 articles included in reading the full text, 10 studies were selected for the qualitative analysis in the present systematic review. All ten articles analyzed through the critical assessment checklist Joanna Briggs institute showed a low risk of bias. The total number of samples in the evaluated articles was 18 patients with vestibular implants. Conclusions: Taken together, these findings support the feasibility of vestibular implant for restoration of the vestibulo-ocular reflex in a broad frequency range and illustrate new challenges for the development of this technology.

  CSV Title: cPLA2a correlates with metastasis and poor prognosis of osteosarcoma by facilitating epithelial-mesenchymal transition
  CSV Abstract: Background: Osteosarcoma (OS) patients with metastasis have very dismal prognoses, and lack effective target therapies. Overexpression of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) has been shown to promote progression in several types of cancers, but its functions in OS have not been investigated. Materials and methods: In our study, the expression of cPLA2a was detected with immunohistochemistry in 102 cases of OS. The clinical significance of cPLA2a was evaluated by analyzing its correlation with clinicopathological factors. The prognostic significance of cPLA2a was estimated by univariate and multivariate analysis. The oncogenic functions of cPLA2a on cell proliferation and invasion were investigated by MTT assay and tranwell assay respectively. Western blotting was applied to detect the markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) after silencing cPLA2a expression or inhibiting its activity by a specific antagonist. Results: In our study, high expression of cPLA2a was significantly associated with metastasis and advanced Enneking stage. High cPLA2a expression was significantly associated with poor prognosis and it was an independent prognostic biomarker of OS. By silencing cPLA2a or inhibiting its activity by a specific antagonist, we demonstrated that cPLA2a promoted cell invasion of OS cells via inducing the EMT process. Conclusions: High cPLA2a expression was an independent prognostic biomarker of OS, and cPLA2a could promote OS cell invasion via inducing the EMT process, indicating that cPLA2a was an independent prognostic biomarker and may be an effective drug target for OS.

  CSV Title: Evolutionary acquisition of complex traits in artificial epigenetic networks
  CSV Abstract: How complex traits arise within organisms over evolutionary time is an important question that has relevance both to the understanding of biological systems and to the design of bio-inspired computing systems. This paper investigates the process of acquiring complex traits within epiNet, a recurrent connectionist architecture capable of adapting its topology during execution. Inspired by the biological processes of gene regulation and epigenetics, epiNet captures biological organisms’ ability to alter their regulatory topologies according to environmental stimulus. By applying epiNet to a series of computational tasks, each requiring a range of complex behaviours to solve, and capturing the evolutionary process in detail, we can show not only how the physical structure of epiNet changed when acquiring complex traits, but also how these changes in physical structure affected its dynamic behaviour. This is facilitated by using a lightweight optimisation method which makes minor iterative changes to the network structure so that when complex traits emerge for the first time, a direct lineage can be observed detailing exactly how they evolved. From this we can build an understanding of how complex traits evolve and which regulatory environments best allow for the emergence of these complex traits, pointing us towards computational models that allow more swift and robust acquisition of complex traits when optimised in an evolutionary computing setting.

  CSV Title: Spatiotemporal dynamics of the Pacific chub mackerel revealed by standardized abundance indices
  CSV Abstract: Standardization of catch per unit effort is an effective way to not only extract temporal abundance trends but also understand distribution shifts of fish resources. Chub mackerel in the Northwest Pacific has recently been of great concern to fishermen and fisheries managers because the total catch has been increasing, and fishing grounds have expanded from the Japanese exclusive economic zone eastward to high-sea areas. Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of chub mackerel is urgently needed for evaluating the current status (i.e., abundance and distribution) and considering future exploitation. Here we constructed two recruitment indices from pelagic trawl survey data of the Pacific chub mackerel. For recruitment indices of age-0 fish, we integrated an algorithm for automatic area stratification into the delta-GLM that combines two separate generalized linear models (for encounter probability and positive catch rates) to simultaneously investigate changes in relative abundance and distribution. Recruitment indices were high in the recent years of 2013, 2016, and 2017, especially at around 160 °E longitude within the high-sea areas, suggesting simultaneous changes in abundance and distribution. Furthermore, we found that our approach had better predictive ability, especially for positive catch rates, than that of a generalized additive model by cross validation, and the obtained standardized indices mitigated potential bias in stock assessment estimates. Our integrated approach will be useful for understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of fishes and standardizing abundance indices for stock assessment and management.

  CSV Title: Entropy generation of nanofluid flow in a microchannel heat sink
  CSV Abstract: Present study aims to investigate the effects of the presence of nano sized TiO2 particles in the base fluid on entropy generation rate in a microchannel heat sink. Pure water was chosen as base fluid, and TiO2 particles were suspended into the pure water in five different particle volume fractions of 0.25%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0%. Under laminar, steady state flow and constant heat flux boundary conditions, thermal, frictional, total entropy generation rates and entropy generation number ratios of nanofluids were experimentally analyzed in microchannel flow for different channel heights of 200 µm, 300 µm, 400 µm and 500 µm. It was observed that frictional and total entropy generation rates increased as thermal entropy generation rate were decreasing with an increase in particle volume fraction. In microchannel flows, thermal entropy generation could be neglected due to its too low rate smaller than 1.10e−07 in total entropy generation. Higher channel heights caused higher thermal entropy generation rates, and increasing channel height yielded an increase from 30% to 52% in thermal entropy generation. When channel height decreased, an increase of 66%–98% in frictional entropy generation was obtained. Adding TiO2 nanoparticles into the base fluid caused thermal entropy generation to decrease about 1.8%–32.4%, frictional entropy generation to increase about 3.3%–21.6%.

  CSV Title: The underlying mechanisms of enhanced microwave absorption performance for the NiFe2O4-decorated Ti3C2Tx MXene
  CSV Abstract: Incorporation of magnetic loss component is more favorable to high-performance microwave absorbing materials. In this paper, the NiFe2O4-decorated Ti3C2Tx MXene composites were synthesized by the in-situ chemical co-precipitation method. The magnetic NiFe2O4 nanoparticles were attached on the surfaces or inserted into the interlayers of Ti3C2Tx MXene. Interestingly, we reduced effectively complex permittivity and enhanced magnetic loss by increasing the NiFe2O4 content on Ti3C2Tx MXene. Stronger electromagnetic attenuation ability and preferable impedance matching property were achieved and considered to be responsible mainly for improving absorbing peaks as well as bandwidth of the NiFe2O4-Ti3C2Tx MXene composite. In particular, the NiFe2O4-Ti3C2Tx-20 sample exhibited an optimal effective absorption bandwidth (RL < −10 dB) of 7.68 GHz with the material thickness of only 1.5 mm. These findings are believed to pave the way of further promoting microwave absorption performance of Ti3C2Tx MXene from magnetic functionalized decoration of view.

  CSV Title: TFG Promotes Organization of Transitional ER and Efficient Collagen Secretion
  CSV Abstract: Collagen is the most abundant protein in the animal kingdom. It is of fundamental importance during development for cell differentiation and tissue morphogenesis as well as in pathological processes such as fibrosis and cancer cell migration. However, our understanding of the mechanisms of procollagen secretion remains limited. Here, we show that TFG organizes transitional ER (tER) and ER exit sites (ERESs) into larger structures. Depletion of TFG results in dispersion of tER elements that remain associated with individual ER-Golgi intermediate compartments (ERGICs) as largely functional ERESs. We show that TFG is not required for the transport and packaging of small soluble cargoes but is necessary for the export of procollagen from the ER. Our work therefore suggests a key relationship between the structure and function of ERESs and a central role for TFG in optimizing COPII assembly for procollagen export.

  CSV Title: Self-Other Mergence in the Frontal Cortex during Cooperation and Competition
  CSV Abstract: To survive, humans must estimate their own ability and the abilities of others. We found that, although people estimated their abilities on the basis of their own performance in a rational manner, their estimates of themselves were partly merged with the performance of others. Reciprocally, their ability estimates for others also reflected their own, as well as the others’, performance. Self-other mergence operated in a context-dependent manner: interacting with high or low performers, respectively, enhanced and diminished own ability estimates in cooperative contexts, but the opposite occurred in competitive contexts. Self-other mergence not only influenced subjective evaluations, it also affected how people subsequently objectively adjusted their performance. Perigenual anterior cingulate cortex tracked one's own performance. Dorsomedial frontal area 9 tracked others’ performances, but also integrated contextual and self-related information. Self-other mergence increased with the strength of self and other representations in area 9, suggesting it carries interdependent representations of self and other.

  CSV Title: Tethering of SCFDia2 to the Replisome Promotes Efficient Ubiquitylation and Disassembly of the CMG Helicase
  CSV Abstract: Disassembly of the Cdc45-MCM-GINS (CMG) DNA helicase, which unwinds the parental DNA duplex at eukaryotic replication forks, is the key regulated step during replication termination but is poorly understood [1, 2]. In budding yeast, the F-box protein Dia2 drives ubiquitylation of the CMG helicase at the end of replication, leading to a disassembly pathway that requires the Cdc48 segregase [3]. The substrate-binding domain of Dia2 comprises leucine-rich repeats, but Dia2 also has a TPR domain at its amino terminus that interacts with the Ctf4 and Mrc1 subunits of the replisome progression complex [4, 5], which assembles around the CMG helicase at replication forks [6]. Previous studies suggested two disparate roles for the TPR domain of Dia2, either mediating replisome-specific degradation of Mrc1 and Ctf4 [4] or else tethering SCFDia2 (SCF [Skp1/cullin/F-box protein]) to the replisome to increase its local concentration at replication forks [5]. Here, we show that SCFDia2 does not mediate replisome-specific degradation of Mrc1 and Ctf4, either during normal S phase or in response to replication stress. Instead, the tethering of SCFDia2 to the replisome progression complex increases the efficiency of ubiquitylation of the Mcm7 subunit of CMG, both in vitro and in vivo. Correspondingly, loss of tethering reduces the efficiency of CMG disassembly in vivo and is synthetic lethal in combination with a disassembly-defective allele of CDC48. Residual ubiquitylation of Mcm7 in dia2-ΔTPR cells is still CMG specific, highlighting the complex regulation of the final stages of chromosome replication, about which much still remains to be learned.

  CSV Title: Use of non-Saccharomyces yeast strains as starter cultures to enhance fermented mango juice production
  CSV Abstract: The aim of this study was to assess the fermentative performances of non-Saccharomyces species (Hanseniaspora jacobsenii, Candida ethanolica) isolated and identified from palmyra wine produced in Ivory Coast and used as starter cultures in fermented mango juices production. Fermented mango juice inoculated from H. jacobsenii pure culture allowed an important acidifiation of juice with pH 4.96 ± 00 and titratable acidity 0.45 ± 0.03% than juices inoculated from C. ethanolica pure culture and mixed culture (H. jacobsenii + C. ethanolica). The organic acids content of the fermented juices were 46.73 ± 7.83, 50.59 ± 6.99 and 54.66 ± 7.73 g/L respectively for H. jacobsenii, C. ethanolica and mixed culture, treatments. At the end of the fermentation, mixed culture treated juice recorded the least sugar content (155.91 g/L) whilst the H. jacobsenii strain treated juice recorded the highest total sugar of 581.94 g/L. Fermented mango juice produced from H. jacobsenii contained the most low ethanol content 1.2 ± 0.08% v/v and this inoculated by mixed culture produced the most high ethanol rate with 3.06 ± 0.04% v/v. During fermentation, the microbial dynamic was most important with mixed culture where final cell concentration was 11.04 ± 2.4 log (CFU/mL). H. jacobsenii strain seemed appropriate for fermented mango juice, this strains produced the low ethanol content and allowed an important acifidification in comparison to C. ethanolica strain and mixed culture.

  CSV Title: Pharmacy in transition: A work sampling study of community pharmacists using smartphone technology
  CSV Abstract: Introduction: The nature of community pharmacy is changing, shifting from the preparation and distribution of medicines to the provision of cognitive pharmaceutical services (CPS); however, often the provision of traditional services leaves little time for innovative services. This study investigated the time community pharmacists spend on the tasks and activities of daily practice and to what extent they are able to implement CPS-related services in daily practice. Methods: Self-reporting work sampling was used to register the activities of community pharmacists. A smartphone application, designed specifically for this purpose, alerted participants to register their current activity five times per working day for 6 weeks. Participants also completed an online survey about baseline characteristics. Results: Ninety-one Dutch community pharmacists provided work-sampling data (7848 registered activities). Overall, 51.5% of their time was spent on professional activities, 35.4% on semi-professional activities, and 13.1% on non-professional activities. The proportion of time devoted to CPS decreased during the workweek, whereas the time spent on traditional task increased. Discussion and conclusion: This study shows it is feasible to collect work-sampling data using smartphone technology. Community pharmacists spent almost half of their time on semi-professional and non-professional activities, activities that could be delegated to other staff members. In practice, the transition to CPS is hampered by competing traditional tasks, which prevents community pharmacists from profiling themselves as pharmaceutical experts in daily practice.

Here, we review the genetic variants that have been implicated in chronic pain conditions, divided into the following etiologically-grouped categories: migraine, musculoskeletal pain disorders, neuropathic pain disorders, and visceral pain disorders. In rare familial monogenic pain conditions several strong-effect mutations have been identified. In contrast, the genetic landscape of common chronic pain conditions suggests minor contributions from a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms representing different functional pathways. A comprehensive survey of up-to-date genetic association results reveals migraine and musculoskeletal pain to be the most investigated chronic pain disorders, in which nearly half of identified genetic variability alters neurotransmission pathways.

  CSV Title: SERS detection of Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin serotypes A and B in buffer and serum: Towards the development of a biodefense test platform
  CSV Abstract: Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are classified at a highest degree of threat in biodefense, due largely to their high lethality. With the growing risk of biowarfare, the shortcomings of the gold standard test for these neurotoxins, the mouse bioassay, have underscored the need to develop alternative diagnostic testing strategies. This paper reports on the detection of inactivated Clostridium botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (BoNT-A) and serotype B (BoNT-B), the two most important markers of botulism infection, by using a sandwich immunoassay, gold nanoparticle labels, and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) within the context of two threat scenarios. The first scenario mimics part of the analysis needed in response to a “white powder” threat by measuring both neurotoxins in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), a biocompatible solvent often used to recover markers dispersed in a powdered matrix. The second scenario detects the two neurotoxins in spiked human serum to assess the clinical potential of the platform. The overall goal is to develop a test applicable to both scenarios in terms of projections of required levels of detection. We demonstrate the ability to measure BoNT-A and BoNT-B in PBS at a limit of detection (LoD) of 700 pg/mL (5 pM) and 84 pg/mL (0.6 pM), respectively, and in human serum at 1200 pg/mL (8 pM) and 91 pg/mL (0.6 pM), respectively, with a time to result under 24 h. The steps required to transform this platform into an onsite biodefense screening tool that can simultaneously and rapidly detect (<1 h) these and other agents are briefly discussed.

  CSV Title: Wind shear data at two different terrain types
  CSV Abstract: The measurement of this data aims to evaluate the wind shear variability at three selected sites in Malaysia. The sites are Kudat in Sabah, Kijal in Terengganu and Langkawi in Kedah. Both sites in Kudat and Kijal is located in coastal areas with few buildings or trees, while the site in Langkawi is a coastal area with many buildings or trees. The variables were measured using the sensors that mounted on the wind mast with the maximum height from 55 m to 70 m from ground level. The variables measured were wind speed, wind direction, temperature, and pressure, while the wind shear data were directly generated using the power law equation. The averaged wind shear based on measured multiple height wind speed at selected sites is larger than the 1/7 law (0.143). Also, the value of wind shear was higher in order Langkawi > Kudat > Kijal. Ultimately, the wind shear data are essential and can be reused in the wind energy potential study, especially for data extrapolation to desired wind turbine hub height.

  CSV Title: Trees, soils, and warthogs – Distribution of services and disservices from reforestation areas in southern Ethiopia
  CSV Abstract: Conservation projects have often been criticised for creating global benefits while causing negative impacts on local livelihoods. Ecosystem services approaches have been seen as one way to change this by focussing explicitly on maintaining ecosystems for human well-being of stakeholders at various scales. However, ecosystem services approaches have often ignored trade-offs between groups of people and issues of power and do not automatically lead to better outcomes in terms of human well-being. Here we report on a study on the impacts of reforestation projects with an explicit focus on human well-being in three communities in southern Ethiopia. We investigated the distribution of services and disservices from reforestation using qualitative methods. Results showed that the services and disservices from reforestation were distributed unequally across space and wealth groups resulting in widespread dissatisfaction with existing reforestation projects despite the explicit focus on human benefits. To improve outcomes of reforestation it is necessary to acknowledge and manage disservices adaptively, include issues of power and make trade-offs transparent.

  CSV Title: Optimising the collection of female genital tract fluid for cytokine analysis in pregnant women
  CSV Abstract: Introduction: To better understand the immunology of pregnancy, study of female genital tract fluid (FGF) is desirable. However the optimum method of collection of FGF in pregnant women for immunological methods, specifically cytokine measurement, is unknown. Methods: A prospective study of HIV-uninfected pregnant women comparing two methods of FGF collection: polyvinyl acetal sponge collection of cervical fluid (CF) and menstrual cup collection of cervicovaginal fluid (CVF). Samples were collected at 3 time points across the second and third trimesters: 14–21, 22–25 and 26–31 weeks. Multiplex chemi-luminescent assays were used to measure: IFN-γ IL-1β IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13 and TNF-α. Optimal methodology for cytokine normalisation (sample weight, volume and total protein) was explored. Results: All cytokines were measurable in both fluid types. IL-1β IL-8 and IL-6 were detected at the highest concentrations (ranking order CF > CVF > plasma). CVF collection was simpler, provided the largest volume of sample (median 0.5 g) with the potential for undiluted usage, and allowed for self-insertion. CF cytokine concentrations were intrinsically associated with sample weight and protein concentration however CVF cytokines were independent of these. Conclusion: Both methods of collection are robust for measurement of FGF cytokines during pregnancy. We recommend CVF collection using a menstrual cup as a viable option in pregnant women for high dimensional biological techniques.

  CSV Title: Visualisation of alternating shielding gas flow in GTAW
  CSV Abstract: The alternating shielding gas technique is a method of achieving transient arc characteristics during arc welding; however the complex flow that occurs through its use has not been investigated previously. A schlieren system was used to image density gradients that arise when alternating argon and helium shield gases, under varying flow parameters, with gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW). A theoretical analysis was carried out to determine the conditions under which the technique facilitates arc pulsing, in particular to avoid mixing of the shield gases in the delivery pipe prior to the welding nozzle. At appropriate pulsing frequency and flow rates, a stable horizontal region of helium was observed in the weld region, maintained in position by the denser argon from the preceding pulse. This higher than average mass fraction of helium when applying the shielding gases alternately, compared to a premixed gas with the same volume of argon and helium, increased the weld penetration by 13% on average, suggesting a modest improvement in heat transfer.

  CSV Title: Dual-action platinum(II) Schiff base complexes: Photocytotoxicity and cellular imaging
  CSV Abstract: Nine photo-stable Pt(II) Schiff base complexes [Pt(O^N^N^O)] (Pt1–Pt9) containing tetradentate salicylaldimine chelating ligands have been synthesized and characterized as potential photosensitisers for photodynamic therapy (PDT). The effects of electron-withdrawing versus electron-donating substituents on their electronic spectral properties are investigated. Pt1–Pt9 show broad absorption bands between 400–600 nm, which makes them useful for green-light photodynamic therapy. The complexes showed intense phosphorescence with emission maxima at ca. 625 nm. This emission was used to track their cellular localization in cancer cells. Confocal cellular imaging showed that the complexes localized mostly in the cytoplasm. In the dark, the complexes were non-toxic to A549 human lung cancer cells, but exhibited high photo-toxicity upon low-dose green light (520 nm, 7.02 J/cm2) irradiation via photo-induced singlet oxygen generation. Thus, these photoactive Pt(II) complexes have the potential to overcome the problem of drug resistance and side effects of current clinical Pt(II) drugs, and to act as both theranostic as well as therapeutic agents.

  CSV Title: High precision microfluidic microencapsulation of bacteriophages for enteric delivery
  CSV Abstract: A Salmonella specific bacteriophage Felix O1 (Myoviridae) was microencapsulated in a pH responsive polymer formulation. The formulation incorporated a pH responsive methacrylic acid copolymer Eudragit® S100 (10% (w/v)) with the addition of the biopolymer sodium alginate, the composition of which was varied in the range (0.5% (w/v)–2% (w/v)). The microencapsulation process employed commercially available microfluidic droplet generation devices. We have used readily available low cost microfluidic chips instead of bespoke in-house fabricated glass capillary devices which are accessible only in specialist research facilities. We show that these co-flow microfluidic devices can easily be used to prepare phage encapsulated microparticles making them suitable for use by both the phage research community and industry in order to evaluate and optimise phage compatible formulations for microencapsulation. A novelty of the work reported here is that the size of the generated monodispersed droplets could be precisely controlled in the range 50 μm–200 μm by varying the flow rates of the dispersed and continuous phases. Consequently, alginate concentration and microparticle size were shown to influence the phage release profile and the degree of acid protection afforded to phages upon exposure to simulated gastric fluid (SGF). Bigger microparticles (∼100 μm) showed better acid protection compared with smaller beads (∼50 μm) made from the same formulation. Increasing the alginate composition resulted in improved acid protection of phages for similar particle sizes. The high viscosity formulations containing higher amounts of alginate (e.g. 2% (w/v)) negatively affected ease of droplet generation in the microfluidic device thereby posing a limitation in terms of process scale-up. Felix O1 encapsulated in the formulation containing 10% (w/v) ES100 and 1% (w/v) alginate showed excellent protection upon exposure of the gelled microparticles to SGF (pH 1 for 2 h) without the use of any antacids in the encapsulation matrix. Encapsulated phages previously exposed to SGF (pH 1 for 2 h) were released at elevated pH in simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) and were shown to arrest bacterial growth in the log growth phase. We have therefore demonstrated the microencapsulation of phages using readily available microfluidic chips to produce solid dosage microcapsule forms with a rapid pH triggered release profile suitable for targeted delivery and controlled release in the gastrointestinal tract.

  CSV Title: Rapid Turnover of the Cardiac L-Type CaV1.2 Channel by Endocytic Recycling Regulates Its Cell Surface Availability
  CSV Abstract: Calcium entry through CaV1.2 L-type calcium channels regulates cardiac contractility. Here, we study the impact of exocytic and post-endocytic trafficking on cell surface channel abundance in cardiomyocytes. Single-molecule localization and confocal microscopy reveal an intracellular CaV1.2 pool tightly associated with microtubules from the perinuclear region to the cell periphery, and with actin filaments at the cell cortex. Channels newly inserted into the plasma membrane become internalized with an average time constant of 7.5 min and are sorted out to the Rab11a-recycling compartment. CaV1.2 recycling suffices for maintaining stable L-type current amplitudes over 20 hr independent of de novo channel transport along microtubules. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton re-routes CaV1.2 from recycling toward lysosomal degradation. We identify endocytic recycling as essential for the homeostatic regulation of voltage-dependent calcium influx into cardiomyocytes. This mechanism provides the basis for a dynamic adjustment of the channel's surface availability and thus, of heart's contraction. Optical Imaging; Molecular Mechanism of Behavior; Cell Biology

  CSV Title: Influence of a family 29 carbohydrate binding module on the recombinant production of galactose oxidase in Pichia pastoris
  CSV Abstract: Herein, we report the extracellular expression of carbohydrate active fusion enzymes in Pichia pastoris. Particularly, CBM29-1-2 from Piromyces equi was separately fused to the N- and C-terminus of galactose 6-oxidase (GaO, D-galactose: oxygen 6-oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.13.9, CAZy family AA5) from Fusarium graminearum, generating CBM29-GaO and GaO-CBM29, respectively. P. pastoris was transformed with expression vectors encoding GaO, CBM29-GaO and GaO-CBM29, and the fusion proteins were expressed in both shake-flask and 2L bioreactor systems. Volumetric production yields and specific GaO activity increased when expression was performed in a bioreactor system compared to shake-flask cultivation. This was observed for both CBM29-GaO and GaO-CBM29, and is consistent with previous reports of GaO expression in P. pastoris (Spadiut et al., 2010; Anasontzis et al., 2014) [1,2]. Fusion of CBM29 to the C-terminal of GaO (GaO-CBM29) resulted in a stable uniform protein at the expected calculated size (107 kDa) when analyzed with SDS-PAGE. By comparison, the expression of the N-terminal fusion protein (CBM29-GaO) was low, and two truncated versions of CBM29-GaO were coexpressed with the full-sized protein. Despite differences in protein yield, the specific GaO activity on galactose was not affected by CBM29 fusion to either the N- or C-terminus of the enzyme. A detailed description of the catalytic and physiochemical properties of CBM29-GaO and GaO-CBM29 is available in the parent publication (Mollerup et al., 2015) [3].

  CSV Title: Effect of harvest date on growth, production and quality of honeybush (Cyclopia genistoides and C. subternata)
  CSV Abstract: Cyclopia spp., used for production of honeybush herbal tea, is endemic to specific climatic zones in the Western and Eastern Cape of South Africa. Most of the plant material is harvested from wild plants in mountainous areas. Production and market development of this popular herbal tea is unsustainable without increased commercial production. Information on cultivation requirements, growth habit and production potential is essential to ensure a sustainable industry. The effect of harvest date on growth, production and tea quality was evaluated in non-irrigated commercial plantations of Cyclopia genistoides and Cyclopia subternata. Cyclopia genistoides bushes, harvested annually, did not recover the height of un-harvested bushes. Fastest C. genistoides bush regrowth and highest dry mass yield occurred after February harvests, with September harvests resulting in the highest sieve quality and mangiferin content (only the second annual harvest). For the “fermented” product, its hot water soluble solids (as indication of cup strength) and total polyphenol content, tended to increase with years of harvest. The mangiferin content of “unfermented” (green) C. genistoides plant material increased with years of harvest. Cyclopia subternata bushes harvested during August and September recovered the fastest in height. The August and May harvests delivered the highest fresh mass yield, while harvesting during August delivered significantly more of the finer processed tea (< 1400 μm) and less of the coarse fraction (> 2800 μm) than a September, February or May harvest. Annual harvesting is encouraged, but harvesting should not take place during flowering (August to September), because the flowers add very little to the final product yield. Based on 10,000 bushes/ha, an estimated annual production of 8.5 or 10.4 tons/ha of C. genistoides and C. subternata (fresh plant material), respectively, can be achieved.

  CSV Title: Clastic patterned ground in Lomonosov crater, Mars: examining fracture controlled formation mechanisms
  CSV Abstract: The area surrounding Lomonosov crater on Mars has a high density of seemingly organised boulder patterns. These form seemingly sorted polygons and stripes within kilometre scale blockfields, patches of boulder strewn ground which are common across the Martian high latitudes. Several hypotheses have been suggested to explain the formation of clastic patterned ground on Mars. It has been proposed that these structures could have formed through freeze-thaw sorting, or conversely by the interaction of boulders with underlying fracture polygons. In this investigation a series of sites were examined to evaluate whether boulder patterns appear to be controlled by the distribution of underlying fractures and test the fracture control hypotheses for their formation. It was decided to focus on this suite of mechanisms as they are characterised by a clear morphological relationship, namely the presence of an underlying fracture network which can easily be evaluated over a large area. It was found that in the majority of examples at these sites did not exhibit fracture control. Although fractures were present at many sites there were very few sites where the fracture network appeared to be controlling the boulder distribution. In general these were not the sites with the best examples of organization, suggesting that the fracture control mechanisms are not the dominant geomorphic process organising the boulders in this area.

  CSV Title: The rusts of wild rye in South Africa
  CSV Abstract: Background: Secale strictum subsp. africanum, a self-fertile and perennial wild rye species, is endemic to the Roggeveld Mountains of the south-western Karoo, South Africa. Despite historical abundance on the Roggeveld plateau, S. strictum subsp. africanum is currently threatened with extinction. Many reasons have been given for its decline, including susceptibility to rusts. Methods: Leaves with stem, leaf and stripe rust pustules were sampled from cultivated and naturally occurring S. strictum subsp. africanum on the farm Kanariesfontein near Sutherland. Identity of the rust pathogens was determined through infection and sequencing studies. Results: Inoculation studies showed that stem and leaf rust collected from wild rye were avirulent on bread wheat, but virulent on Secale cereale. The stripe rust specimen was virulent on bread wheat and was identified as Puccinia striiformis race 6E16A-. Using ITS sequencing, the wild rye leaf rust specimen was confirmed as Puccinia recondita, and the stripe rust specimen as P. striiformis. ITS sequences did not distinguish between Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici and Puccinia graminis f. sp. secalis, respectively the causal organisms of wheat and rye stem rust. Inoculation of wild rye plants with P. graminis f. sp. tritici proved its susceptibility to stem rust races attacking wheat and triticale. Conclusion: This study established that S. strictum subsp. africanum is a host for both rye and wheat stem rust, rye leaf rust and wheat stripe rust.

  CSV Title: Citizens’ sustainable, future-oriented energy behaviours in energy transition
  CSV Abstract: This study explored individuals' engagement in the sustainable energy transition in Finland. Using the attitude-behaviour-context model (Guagnano et al., 1995) and Stern's (2000) typology of environmentally significant behaviours, this study tested the assumption that individuals' engagement in transition is a combination of socio-psychological and contextual (socio-economic) variables and that the active engagement requires individuals to have a future orientation, systemic and self-efficacy, subjective knowledge and a pro-environmental attitude. The survey (N = 1012), representative of the 17−75-year-old Finnish population, was analysed with exploratory factor analysis and linear regression. The socio-psychological variables explained a larger portion of variance than the socio-economic variables in all three types of sustainable energy behaviours. The consideration of future consequences, self-efficacy and knowledge were positively associated with all three types of sustainable energy behaviours. Systemic efficacy was positively associated with and the consideration of immediate consequences was negatively associated with private-sphere environmentalism. The results suggest that individuals' consideration of the immediate and distant future should be included in the socio-psychological models of sustainable behaviours. The results also suggest that policymakers need to focus on strengthening citizens' efficacy beliefs, future orientation and knowledge.

  CSV Title: Water Framework Directive programmes of measures: Lessons from the 1st planning cycle of a catchment in England
  CSV Abstract: The European Union's Water Framework Directive (WFD) required Member States to establish programmes of measures to achieve good water status formally by 2015, but on postponing the deadline by two six-year periods, by 2027 at the latest. With many Member States facing problems with developing such measures in the first planning cycle, and limited change in ecological status since the first river basin management plans were reported, we look at the implementation of the Directive in England, where only 17% of the surface water bodies were found at good status in 2015, a reduction of 4% since 2009. Using as a case study the Broadland Rivers catchment, we examine the measures taken for Cycle 1 and changes in the classifications of water body status, to investigate whether the way the measures were developed could have limited their potential to deliver WFD objectives. While the WFD was adopted to succeed and replace management practices targeting individually non-compliant element, findings indicate that little had changed in the way measures were developed. Although considerable progress has been made on the implementation of these measures, the limited progress in improving classifications demonstrates the limits of this approach and further makes the case for what the WFD was introduced for: the harmonised transposition of the Integrated River Basin Management paradigm, as the key for delivering good ecological status.

  CSV Title: Development of a GFP-expressing Ustilaginoidea virens strain to study fungal invasion and colonization in rice spikelets
  CSV Abstract: The fungal pathogen Ustilaginoidea virens is now widespread in most rice producing areas of the world and attacks the seed spikes of rice, causing sterility, reduced seed weight and accumulation of mycotoxins. The lack of appropriate data relating to the mechanisms of infection leaves a gap within the pathosystem, forcing the search for new methodologies for monitoring the disease. Here, we developed an efficient A. tumefaciens mediated transformation system for rice false smut disease. In addition, infection patterns were explored in rice using the green fluorescent protein gene (gfp) transformed U. virens. ATMT uses both the Hygromycin B resistance (hph) gene and green fluorescent protein as the selection agents. The T-DNA integration into the fungal genome was assessed by PCR. Expression of the gfp gene did not affect the pathogenicity of the U. virens transformants. U. virens pathogenicity was examined on the floral structures using a fluorescence microscope. Fluorescence microscopy allowed in vivo imaging of this pathogen during infection of rice spikelets. These studies will allow us to develop strategies to determine the mechanisms of U. virens-rice interaction in greater detail and to apply functional genomics for the characterization of involved genes at the molecular level either by insertional mutagenesis or gene knock-out.

  CSV Title: Degradation of cognitive timing mechanisms in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia
  CSV Abstract: The current study examined motor timing in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which manifests as progressive deterioration in social, behavioural and cognitive functions. Twenty-patients fulfilling consensus clinical criteria for behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD), 11 patients fulfilling consensus clinical criteria for semantic-variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), four patients fulfilling criteria for nonfluent/agrammatic primary progressive aphasia (naPPA), eight patients fulfilling criteria for Alzheimer[U+05F3]s disease (AD), and 31 controls were assessed on both an externally- and self-paced finger-tapping task requiring maintenance of a regular, 1500. ms beat over 50 taps. Grey and white matter correlates of deficits in motor timing were examined using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). bvFTD patients exhibited significant deficits in aspects of both externally- and self-paced tapping. Increased mean inter-response interval (faster than target tap time) in the self-paced task was associated with reduced grey matter volume in the cerebellum bilaterally, right middle temporal gyrus, and with increased axial diffusivity in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus, regions and tracts which have been suggested to be involved in a subcortical-cortical network of structures underlying timing abilities. This suggests that such structures can be affected in bvFTD, and that impaired motor timing may underlie some characteristics of the bvFTD phenotype.

  CSV Title: Water quality assessment of bitumen polluted Oluwa River, South-Western Nigeria
  CSV Abstract: This study was aimed at establishing a water quality database in the study area where none existed previously. Samples were taken from two different sites of River Oluwa, South-Western Nigeria. Physicochemical and biological factors and the metals for one year (April 2011-March 2012) were evaluated using standard methods. All the physical parameters of the water samples from the two sampling Sites did not show deviations from Nigeria Industrial Standard (NIS) for permissible levels of these parameters in drinking water. Virtually all heavy metals investigated deviated from the permissible levels allowed by NIS, and WHO standards in drinking water. In the same vein, all chemical parameters investigated during the dry season was significantly different from rainy season except for BOD at P < 0.05. Isolated microorganisms include members of the genera Bacillus, Micrococcus, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, Proteus and Staphylococcus. The public health implications of consuming water from this river are fully discussed.

  CSV Title: The public health implications of telematic technologies: An exploratory qualitative study in the UK
  CSV Abstract: Introduction: Reducing motorised transport is crucial for achieving public health goals, but cars will continue to be essential for many in the medium term. The role of emerging technologies in mitigating the public health disadvantages of this private car use has been under-examined to date. Telematics are increasingly used by novice drivers in the UK to reduce insurance premiums. An exploratory study of novice drivers’ experiences of telematics identified implications for public health that warrant urgent further research. Methods: An exploratory qualitative study, using semi-structured interviews with 12 drivers aged 17–25 in three regions of the UK (Aberdeenshire, Hertfordshire and London). Results: Telematics were acceptable to young drivers, and reported to mitigate some negative health consequences of driving (injury risks, over-reliance on car transport), without reducing access to determinants of health such as employment or social life. However, there were suggestions that those at higher risk were less likely to adopt telematics. Conclusion: Market-based mechanisms such as telematics are potential alternatives to well-evaluated policy interventions such as Graduated Driver Licensing for reducing road injury risks for novice drivers, with a different mix of risks and benefits. However, claims to date from insurance companies about the contribution of telematics to public health outcomes should be evaluated carefully to account for biases in uptake.

  CSV Title: Missense variants in the conserved transmembrane M2 protein domain of KCNJ13 associated with retinovascular changes in humans and zebrafish
  CSV Abstract: Mutations in KCNJ13 are associated with two retinal disorders; Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and snowflake vitreoretinal degeneration (SVD). We describe a novel fibrovascular proliferation in the retina of two affected members of a KCNJ13-related LCA family with a homozygous c.458C > T, p.(Thr153Ile) missense mutation. Optical coherence tomography retinal imaging of the kcnj13 mutant zebrafish (obelixtd15 c.502T > C, p.[Phe168Leu]) revealed a late onset retinal degeneration at 12 months, with retinal thinning and associated retinovascular changes, including increased vessel calibre and vitreous deposits. Both human and zebrafish variants are missense and located within the conserved transmembrane M2 protein domain, suggesting that disruption of this region may contribute to retinovascular changes as an additional feature to the previously described LCA phenotype. Close monitoring of other patients with similar mutations may be required to minimise the ensuing retinal damage.

  CSV Title: A conceptual framework for the uptake of the green building concept in Ghana
  CSV Abstract: Green building (GB) is receiving global acclaim as the most formidable answer to the adverse effects brought upon the climate and environment by buildings and construction activities. The developed countries accept this as a best option to the mitigation of the impacts on the environment and have developed codes, policies and frameworks to encourage and enforce the implementation of green building concepts in their construction industries. In a sharp contrast, current evidence suggests that, uptake of GB in developing countries of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is at a snail pace and characterized by the absence of GB codes and frameworks. In response, this study through a critical literature review process, explores theoretical applications of the innovation diffusion theory and theory of planned behavior to develop an understanding of the GB implementation process. The combination of the two theories with other frameworks yields a conceptual framework for the uptake of the green building concepts (GBC) in the Ghana construction industry to facilitate the understanding of a stakeholder's decision to adopt GBC hence improving uptake. For an increased uptake of the concept in Ghana, likely impediments include, lack of awareness, government regulations, financial constraints and cultural change resistance among others. The testable conceptual framework developed would provide the foundation for a comprehensive uptake framework of the green building concepts in the Ghana construction industry.

  CSV Title: Prediction and uncertainty quantification of structure-borne sound radiation into a diffuse field
  CSV Abstract: When predicting the radiation of structure-borne sound into a room, it is often assumed that the generated sound field is diffuse. A diffuse field is by definition a random field, composed of a large number of statistically independent plane waves, the spatial phase of which is uniformly distributed and independent from the amplitude. It may represent the sound field of a conceptual ensemble of rooms with the same modal density and total absorption, but otherwise any possible arrangement of boundaries and small objects that scatter incoming sound waves. Adopting a diffuse field model therefore inherently implies that uncertainty due to random wave scattering is present in the computed results. This uncertainty can be large, especially at low frequencies. In this work, practical formulas are derived for computing not only the mean, but also the variance of energetic level quantities, such as the band-integrated spatially averaged sound pressure level, in a diffuse sound field caused by a mechanically excited structure. The obtained expressions are first verified in a simulation study, and then experimentally validated for a point-loaded bare plate and a rib-stiffened plate. It is found that both the average sound pressure level and its standard deviation can be well predicted. Knowledge of this standard deviation then allows the analyst to estimate, for example, by how much the spatially averaged sound pressure level in one particular room can deviate from the ensemble averaged result, and this for any frequency band.

  CSV Title: Ethnographic context and spatial coherence of climate indicators for farming communities - A multi-regional comparative assessment
  CSV Abstract: Accurate seasonal predictions of rainfall may reduce climatic risks that farmers are usually faced with across the tropical and subtropical zones. However, although regional-scale seasonal amounts have regularly been forecasted since 1997/98, the practical use of these seasonal predictions is still limited by myriad factors. This paper synthesizes the main results of a multi-disciplinary ethnographic and climatic project (PICREVAT). Its main objective was to seek the climatic information - beyond the seasonal amounts - critical for crops, both as an actual constraint to crop yields and as identified by the current and past practices and perceptions of farmers. A second goal was to confront the relevance and significance of this climatic information with its spatial coherence, which gives an upper bound of its potential predictability. The ethnographic and climatic analyses were carried out on three very different fields: North Cameroon (mixed food crops associated with a cash crop - cotton - integrated into a national program); Eastern slopes of Mt Kenya (mixed food crops, with a recent development of maize at the expense of sorghum and pearl millet); and Central Argentina (mixed crops and livestock recently converting to monoculture of transgenic soybean, referred to as soybeanization).The ethnographic surveys, as well as yield-climate functions, emphasized the role played by various intra-seasonal characteristics of the rainy seasons beyond the seasonal rainfall amounts, in both actual yields and people's representations and/or crop management strategies. For instance, the onset of the rainy season in East Africa and North Cameroon, the season duration in the driest district of the eastern slopes of Mount Kenya, or rains at the core (August) and at the end of the rainy season in North Cameroon have been highlighted. The dynamics of farming systems (i.e. soybeanization in Central Argentina, increasing popularity of maize in East Africa, recent decline of cotton in North Cameroon) were also emphasized as active drivers; these slow changes could increase climatic vulnerability (i.e. soybean is far more sensitive to rainfall variations than wheat, maize is less drought-resistant than sorghum or millet), at least for the least flexible actors (such as the non-capitalized farmers in Central Argentina). The cross between ethnographic surveys and climatic analyses enabled us to identify climate variables that are both useful to farmers and potentially predictable. These variables do not appear to be common across the surveyed fields. The best example is the rainy season onset date whose variations, depending on regions, crop species and farming practices may either have a major/minor role in crop performance and/or crop management, or may have a high/low potential predictability.

  CSV Title: Contrasting distributions of urban green infrastructure across social and ethno-racial groups
  CSV Abstract: Links between urban green infrastructure (UGI) and public health benefits are becoming well established. Despite this, how UGI is distributed varies widely. Although not a universal finding, sectors of society that are disadvantaged often suffer from poor provision, something which might be due to which UGI are examined. We assess the distribution of street trees and public greenspaces (two types of publicly-owned and accessible UGI) across the city of Bradford, UK which is characterised by high levels of inequality and variation in ethno-racial background. We do this through statistical and spatial analyses. Street tree density was distributed unevenly and was highest in neighbourhoods with a high proportion of Asian/Asian British residents and with lower socio-economic status. Conversely, neighbourhoods with better access to public greenspaces were characterised by high income and/or a high proportion of White households. While the quality of public greenspace was spatially clustered, there were only limited spatial associations with ethno-racial group or socio-economic status. Population density was a key determinant of the distribution of UGI, suggesting understanding UGI distributions should also focus on urban form. Nevertheless, within the same city we show that equitable distribution of UGI differs according to the form and characteristics of UGI. To fully realise the public health benefits of UGI, it is necessary to map provision and understand the causal drivers of unequal distributions. This would facilitate interventions that promote equitable distributions of UGI based on the needs of the target populations.

  CSV Title: The lost stone — Laparoscopic exploration of abscess cavity and retrieval of lost gallstone post cholecystectomy: A case series and review of the literature
  CSV Abstract: Background: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is considered the gold standard operation for symptomatic gallstones. Gallbladder perforation occurs in 6–40% of operations. It can lead to spillage of gallstones into the abdominal cavity with possible consequences of long-term complications. We report two cases where a unique use of laparoscopic technique was used to explore abscess cavity and retrieve lost gallstones without penetrating the peritoneal cavity. Case presentation: We report two cases of peri-hepatic abscess treated with laparoscopic cavity exploration, using 5 mm and 10 mm ports, to retrieve lost gallstones. It was done without entering the peritoneal cavity. Discussion: Today, minimally invasive technique is used in a variety of surgical cases. We report a novel technique, using laparoscopic skills, to drain abscesses caused by lost gallstones post LC without entering the peritoneal cavity. The use of minimally invasive surgery techniques in order to explore abscess cavities not only help us to extract the cause of the abscess but also prevents another surgery in the abdominal cavity. Conclusion: Laparoscopic exploration of an abscess cavity is a feasible and safe technique treating long-term complications of gallbladder perforation post LC.

  CSV Abstract: The endothelium exerts many vasoprotective effects that are largely mediated by release of nitric oxide (NO). Endothelial dysfunction represents an early but reversible step in atherosclerosis and is characterized by a reduction in the bioavailability of NO. Previous studies have shown that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), an omega-3 fatty acid (O3FA), and statins individually improve endothelial cell function, but their effects in combination have not been tested. Through a series of in vitro experiments, this study evaluated the effects of a combined treatment of EPA and the active metabolite of atorvastatin (ATM) on endothelial cell function under conditions of oxidative stress. Specifically, the comparative and time-dependent effects of these agents on endothelial dysfunction were examined by measuring the levels of NO and peroxynitrite (ONOO−) released from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The data suggest that combined treatment with EPA and ATM is beneficial to endothelial function and was unique to EPA and ATM since similar improvements could not be recapitulated by substituting another O3FA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or other TG-lowering agents such as fenofibrate, niacin, or gemfibrozil. Comparable beneficial effects were observed when HUVECs were pretreated with EPA and ATM before exposure to oxidative stress. Interestingly, the kinetics of EPA-based protection of endothelial function in response to oxidation were found to be significantly different than those of DHA. Lastly, the beneficial effects on endothelial function generated by combined treatment of EPA and ATM were reproduced when this study was expanded to an ex vivo model utilizing rat glomerular endothelial cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that a combined treatment of EPA and ATM can inhibit endothelial dysfunction that occurs in response to conditions such as hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and dyslipidemia.

  CSV Title: A linear model for event-related respiration responses
  CSV Abstract: Background Cognitive processes influence respiratory physiology. This may allow inferring cognitive states from measured respiration. Here, we take a first step towards this goal and investigate whether event-related respiratory responses can be identified, and whether they are accessible to a model-based approach. New method We regard respiratory responses as the output of a linear time invariant system that receives brief inputs after psychological events. We derive average responses to visual targets, aversive stimulation, and viewing of arousing pictures, in interpolated respiration period (RP), respiration amplitude (RA), and respiratory flow rate (RFR). We then base a Psychophysiological Model (PsPM) on these averaged event-related responses. The PsPM is inverted to yield estimates of cognitive input into the respiratory system. This method is validated in an independent data set. Results All three measures show event-related responses, which are captured as non-zero response amplitudes in the PsPM. Amplitude estimates for RA and RFR distinguish between picture viewing and the other tasks. This pattern is replicated in the validation experiment. Comparison with existing methods Existing respiratory measures are based on relatively short time-intervals after an event while the new method is based on the entire duration of respiratory responses. Conclusion Our findings suggest that interpolated respiratory measures show replicable event-related response patterns. PsPM inversion is a suitable approach to analysing these patterns, with a potential to infer cognitive processes from respiration.

  CSV Title: Biomarkers of An Autoimmune Skin Disease-Psoriasis
  CSV Abstract: Psoriasis is one of the most prevalent autoimmune skin diseases. However, its etiology and pathogenesis are still unclear. Over the last decade, omics-based technologies have been extensively utilized for biomarker discovery. As a result, some promising markers for psoriasis have been identified at the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome level. These discoveries have provided new insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways in psoriasis pathogenesis. More importantly, some of these markers may prove useful in the diagnosis of psoriasis and in the prediction of disease progression once they have been validated. In this review, we summarize the most recent findings in psoriasis biomarker discovery. In addition, we will discuss several emerging technologies and their potential for novel biomarker discovery and diagnostics for psoriasis.

  CSV Title: Time-lapse ratios of cone excitations in natural scenes
  CSV Abstract: The illumination in natural environments varies through the day. Stable inferences about surface color might be supported by spatial ratios of cone excitations from the reflected light, but their invariance has been quantified only for global changes in illuminant spectrum. The aim here was to test their invariance under natural changes in both illumination spectrum and geometry, especially in the distribution of shadows. Time-lapse hyperspectral radiance images were acquired from five outdoor vegetated and nonvegetated scenes. From each scene, 10,000 pairs of points were sampled randomly and ratios measured across time. Mean relative deviations in ratios were generally large, but when sampling was limited to short distances or moderate time intervals, they fell below the level for detecting violations in ratio invariance. When illumination changes with uneven geometry were excluded, they fell further, to levels obtained with global changes in illuminant spectrum alone. Within sampling constraints, ratios of cone excitations, and also of opponent-color combinations, provide an approximately invariant signal for stable surface-color inferences, despite spectral and geometric variations in scene illumination.

  CSV Title: Web Resources for Metagenomics Studies
  CSV Abstract: The development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms spawned an enormous volume of data. This explosion in data has unearthed new scalability challenges for existing bioinformatics tools. The analysis of metagenomic sequences using bioinformatics pipelines is complicated by the substantial complexity of these data. In this article, we review several commonly-used online tools for metagenomics data analysis with respect to their quality and detail of analysis using simulated metagenomics data. There are at least a dozen such software tools presently available in the public domain. Among them, MGRAST, IMG/M, and METAVIR are the most well-known tools according to the number of citations by peer-reviewed scientific media up to mid-2015. Here, we describe 12 online tools with respect to their web link, annotation pipelines, clustering methods, online user support, and availability of data storage. We have also done the rating for each tool to screen more potential and preferential tools and evaluated five best tools using synthetic metagenome. The article comprehensively deals with the contemporary problems and the prospects of metagenomics from a bioinformatics viewpoint.

  CSV Title: The Emerging Role of Sperm-Associated Antigen 6 Gene in the Microtubule Function of Cells and Cancer
  CSV Abstract: Accumulated evidence shows that sperm-associated antigen 6 (SPAG6) gene has multiple biological functions. It maintains the normal function of a variety of cells including ciliary/flagellar biogenesis and polarization, neurogenesis, and neuronal migration. Moreover, SPAG6 is found to be critically involved in auditory transduction and the fibroblast life cycle. Furthermore, SPAG6 plays an essential role in immuno-regulation. Notably, SPAG6 has been demonstrated to participate in the occurrence and progression of a variety of human cancers. New evidence shows that SPAG6 gene regulates tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and metastasis. Therefore, in this review, we describe the physiological function and mechanism of SPAG6 in human normal cells and cancer cells. We also highlight that SPAG6 gene may be an effective biomarker for the diagnosis of human cancer. Taken together, targeting SPAG6 could be a novel strategy for the treatment of human diseases including cancer.

  CSV Title: Nitrous oxide emissions from winter oilseed rape cultivation
  CSV Abstract: Winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L., WOSR) is the major oil crop cultivated in Europe. Rapeseed oil is predominantly used for production of biodiesel. The framework of the European Renewable Energy Directive requires that use of biofuels achieves GHG savings of at least 50% compared to use of fossil fuel starting in 2018. However, N2O field emissions are estimated using emission factors that are not specific for the crop and associated with strong uncertainty. N2O field emissions are controlled by N fertilization and dominate the GHG balance of WOSR cropping due to the high global warming potential of N2O. Thus, field experiments were conducted to increase the data basis and subsequently derive a new WOSR-specific emission factor. N2O emissions and crop yields were monitored for three years over a range of N fertilization intensities at five study sites representative of German WOSR production. N2O fluxes exhibited the typical high spatial and temporal variability in dependence on soil texture, weather and nitrogen availability. The annual N2O emissions ranged between 0.24 kg and 5.48 kg N2O-N ha−1 a−1. N fertilization increased N2O emissions, particularly with the highest N treatment (240 kg N ha−1). Oil yield increased up to a fertilizer amount of 120 kg N ha−1, higher N-doses increased grain yield but decreased oil concentrations in the seeds. Consequently oil yield remained constant at higher N fertilization. Since, yield-related emission also increased exponentially with N surpluses, there is potential for reduction of the N fertilizer rate, which offers perspectives for the mitigation of GHG emissions. Our measurements double the published data basis of annual N2O flux measurements in WOSR. Based on this extended dataset we modeled the relationship between N2O emissions and fertilizer N input using an exponential model. The corresponding new N2O emission factor was 0.6% of applied fertilizer N for a common N fertilizer amount under best management practice in WOSR production (200 kg N ha−1 a−1). This factor is substantially lower than the linear IPCC Tier 1 factor (EF1) of 1.0% and other models that have been proposed.

  CSV Title: Graded error signals in eyeblink conditioning
  CSV Abstract: Minimizing errors is an important aspect of learning. However, it is not enough merely to record if an error occurred. For efficient learning, information about the magnitude of errors is critical. Did my tennis swing completely miss the target or did I hit the ball, but not quite in the sweet spot? How can neurons – which have traditionally been thought of as binary units – signal the magnitude of an error? Here I review evidence that eyeblink conditioning – a basic form of motor learning – depends on graded signals from the inferior olive which guides plasticity in the cerebellum and ultimately tunes behavior. Specifically, evidence suggests that: (1) Error signals are conveyed to the cerebellum via the inferior olive; (2) Signals from the inferior olive are graded; (3) The strength of the olivary signal affects learning; (4) Cerebellar feedback influences the strength of the olivary signal. I end the review by exploring how graded error signals might explain some behavioral learning phenomena.

  CSV Title: Optimising Golgi-Cox staining for use with perfusion-fixed brain tissue validated in the zQ175 mouse model of Huntington's disease
  CSV Abstract: Background: The Golgi-Cox stain is an established method for characterising neuron cell morphology. The method highlights neurite processes of stained cells allowing the complexity of dendritic branching to be measured. New methods: Conventional rapid Golgi and Golgi-Cox methods all require fresh impregnation in unfixed brain blocks. Here, we describe a modified method that gives high quality staining on brain tissue blocks perfusion-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and post-fixed by immersion for 24 h. Results: Tissue perfused with 4% PFA and post fixed for 24 h remained viable for the modified Golgi-Cox silver impregnation staining of mouse striatum from perfused wild type and zQ175. It was not found necessary to impregnate tissue blocks with Golgi solutions prior to sectioning, as post-sectioned tissues yielded equally good impregnation. Impregnation for 14 days resulted in optimal visualisation of striatal neuron and dendritic morphology. Although no modifications applied to the rapid Golgi method were reliable, the modified Golgi-Cox method yielded consistently reliable high-quality staining. Comparison with existing methods: The current method used fixed tissues to reduce damage and preserve cell morphology. The revised method was found to be fast, reliable and cost effective without the need for expensive staining kits and could be performed in any neuroscience lab with limited specialist equipment. Conclusions: The present study introduces a robust reproducible and inexpensive staining method for identifying neuronal morphological changes in the post fixed mouse brain, and is suitable for assessing changes in cell morphology in models of neurodegeneration and in response to experimental treatment.

  CSV Title: Chemical Screening Identifies Enhancers of Mutant Oligodendrocyte Survival and Unmasks a Distinct Pathological Phase in Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease
  CSV Abstract:  Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) is a fatal X-linked disorder caused by loss of myelinating oligodendrocytes and consequent hypomyelination. The underlying cellular and molecular dysfunctions are not fully defined, but therapeutic enhancement of oligodendrocyte survival could restore functional myelination in patients. Here we generated pure, scalable quantities of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) from a severe mouse model of PMD, Plp1 jimpy . Temporal phenotypic and transcriptomic studies defined an early pathological window characterized by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cell death as OPCs exit their progenitor state. High-throughput phenotypic screening identified a compound, Ro 25–6981, which modulates the ER stress response and rescues mutant oligodendrocyte survival in jimpy, in vitro and in vivo, and in human PMD oligocortical spheroids. Surprisingly, increasing oligodendrocyte survival did not restore subsequent myelination, revealing a second pathological phase. Collectively, our work shows that PMD oligodendrocyte loss can be rescued pharmacologically and defines a need for multifactorial intervention to restore myelination. Tesar and colleagues interrogate the severe genetic myelin disorder Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) using iPSC-derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Using high-throughput phenotypic screening, they rescue cell death of mutant oligodendrocytes immediately after initiation of differentiation with chemical modulators, including Ro 25–6981. Interestingly oligodendrocyte restoration did not lead to widespread myelination, unmasking a new phase of the disease.

  CSV Title: Accurate forecasts of the effectiveness of interventions against Ebola may require models that account for variations in symptoms during infection
  CSV Abstract: Epidemiological models are routinely used to predict the effects of interventions aimed at reducing the impacts of Ebola epidemics. Most models of interventions targeting symptomatic hosts, such as isolation or treatment, assume that all symptomatic hosts are equally likely to be detected. In other words, following an incubation period, the level of symptoms displayed by an individual host is assumed to remain constant throughout an infection. In reality, however, symptoms vary between different stages of infection. During an Ebola infection, individuals progress from initial non-specific symptoms through to more severe phases of infection. Here we compare predictions of a model in which a constant symptoms level is assumed to those generated by a more epidemiologically realistic model that accounts for varying symptoms during infection. Both models can reproduce observed epidemic data, as we show by fitting the models to data from the ongoing epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the 2014-16 epidemic in Liberia. However, for both of these epidemics, when interventions are altered identically in the models with and without levels of symptoms that depend on the time since first infection, predictions from the models differ. Our work highlights the need to consider whether or not varying symptoms should be accounted for in models used by decision makers to assess the likely efficacy of Ebola interventions.

  CSV Title: Nuclear energy for sustainable development: SWOT analysis on Ghana's nuclear agenda
  CSV Abstract: The development of clean and sustainable energy around the world has become a necessity as a result of the negative effect energy generated from fossil fuel have on the environment. Ghana intends to add nuclear power to its generation mix by 2029. This paper uses the SWOT analysis tool to assess the internal strengths and weaknesses as well as the external opportunities and threats in the country relative to its nuclear power program. We found out that despite the country's effort towards meeting the requirements for the licensing, contracting, construction and operation of the facility, there are still some important loopholes which could delay the process. The research found out that Ghana has a lot of strengths and opportunities that makes an investment in nuclear power an economically viable option. However, issues such as porous security system, corruption, porous borders and policy discontinuity due to changes in political power are threats to the smooth implementation and operation of a nuclear power plant. The research therefore recommended to the government of Ghana to pay critical attention to some of these loopholes. We also looked at a particular weakness which is financing and provided some funding options for its development.

  CSV Title: On the use of non-conformal grids for economic LES of wind flow and convective heat transfer for a wall-mounted cube
  CSV Abstract: Generating economical, high-resolution and high-quality computational grids for Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of wind flow and convective heat transfer (CHT) around surface-mounted obstacles is not straightforward. When the grid size is used as filter, LES grids should ideally consist of cubic cells, while CHT requires a very high near-wall resolution to resolve the thin viscous sublayer and buffer layer that represent the largest resistance to CHT. To avoid very high cell numbers and the need for excessive computational resources, non-conformal grids can be considered. This paper provides a detailed evaluation of the performance of non-conformal grids with cubic cells, for wind flow and CHT around a wall-mounted cubic obstacle. LES results on non-conformal versus conformal grids are compared with each other and with wind-tunnel measurements of wind speed and surface temperature. Moreover, sensitivity analysis is performed concerning the impact of overall grid resolution, subdomain size and grid refinement ratio. Average absolute deviations between LES on non-conformal versus conformal grids are about 0.9% (0.5 °C) for surface temperature on all cube surfaces. Comparison with experiments shows for the non-conformal grid an average and maximum absolute deviation for surface temperature of 2.0% (1.1 °C) and 7.6% (3.6 °C), respectively. The sensitivity analysis shows minor impact of subdomain size on convective heat transfer coefficients (CHTC) where, on average, absolute deviations of less than 2.2% are observed. This study shows that non-conformal grids can strongly reduce the total cell count (here by a factor up to 30.2) without significantly compromising the accuracy of results.

  CSV Title: Assessing the contributions of childhood maltreatment subtypes and depression case-control status on telomere length reveals a specific role of physical neglect
  CSV Abstract: Background Studies have provided evidence that both childhood maltreatment and depressive disorders are associated with shortened telomere lengths. However, as childhood maltreatment is a risk factor for depression, it remains unclear whether this may be driving shortened telomere lengths observed amongst depressed patients. Furthermore, it's unclear if the effects of maltreatment on telomere length shortening are more pervasive amongst depressed patients relative to controls, and consequently whether biological ageing may contribute to depression's pathophysiology. The current study assesses the effects of childhood maltreatment, depression case/control status, and the interactive effect of both childhood maltreatment and depression case/control status on relative telomere length (RTL). Method DNA samples from 80 depressed subjects and 100 control subjects were utilized from a U.K. sample (ages 20–84), with childhood trauma questionnaire data available for all participants. RTL was quantified using quantitative polymerase chain reactions. Univariate linear regression analyses were used to assess the effects of depression status, childhood maltreatment and depression by childhood maltreatment interactions on RTL. The false discovery rate (q<0.05) was used for multiple testing correction. Results Analysis of depression case/control status showed no significant main effect on RTL. Four subtypes of childhood maltreatment also demonstrated no significant main effect on RTL, however a history of physical neglect did significantly predict shorter RTL in adulthood (F(1, 174)=7.559, p=0.007, q=0.042, Variance Explained=4.2%), which was independent of case/control status. RTL was further predicted by severity of physical neglect, with the greatest differences observed in older maltreated individuals (>50 years old). There were no significant depression case/control status by childhood maltreatment interactions. Limitations A relatively small sample limited our power to detect interaction effects, and we were unable to consider depression chronicity or recurrence. Conclusion Shortened RTL was specifically associated with childhood physical neglect, but not the other subtypes of maltreatment or depression case/control status. Our results suggest that the telomere-eroding effects of physical neglect may represent a biological mechanism important in increasing risk for ageing-related disorders. As physical neglect is more frequent amongst depressed cases generally, it may also represent a confounding factor driving previous associations between shorter RTL and depression case status.

  CSV Title: Synthetic microbial communities
  CSV Abstract: While natural microbial communities are composed of a mix of microbes with often unknown functions, the construction of synthetic microbial communities allows for the generation of defined systems with reduced complexity. Used in a top-down approach, synthetic communities serve as model systems to ask questions about the performance and stability of microbial communities. In a second, bottom-up approach, synthetic microbial communities are used to study which conditions are necessary to generate interaction patterns like symbiosis or competition, and how higher order community structure can emerge from these. Besides their obvious value as model systems to understand the structure, function and evolution of microbial communities as complex dynamical systems, synthetic communities can also open up new avenues for biotechnological applications. © 2014.

  CSV Title: Persona-centred information security awareness
  CSV Abstract: Maintaining Information Security and protecting data assets remains a principal concern for businesses. Many data breaches continue to result from accidental, intentional or malicious human factors, leading to financial or reputational loss. One approach towards improving behaviours and culture is with the application of on-going awareness activities. This paper presents an approach for identifying security related human factors by incorporating personas into information security awareness design and implementation. The personas, which are grounded in empirical data, offer a useful method for identifying audience needs and security risks, enabling a tailored approach to business-specific awareness activities. As a means for integrating personas, we present six on-going steps that can be embedded into business-as-usual activities with 90-day cycles of awareness themes, and evaluate our approach with a case study business. Our findings suggest a persona-centred information security awareness approach has the capacity to adapt to the time and resource required for its implementation within the business, and offer a positive contribution towards reducing or mitigating Information Security risks through security awareness.

  CSV Title: A watershed model of individual differences in fluid intelligence
  CSV Abstract: Fluid intelligence is a crucial cognitive ability that predicts key life outcomes across the lifespan. Strong empirical links exist between fluid intelligence and processing speed on the one hand, and white matter integrity and processing speed on the other. We propose a watershed model that integrates these three explanatory levels in a principled manner in a single statistical model, with processing speed and white matter figuring as intermediate endophenotypes. We fit this model in a large (N=555) adult lifespan cohort from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) using multiple measures of processing speed, white matter health and fluid intelligence. The model fit the data well, outperforming competing models and providing evidence for a many-to-one mapping between white matter integrity, processing speed and fluid intelligence. The model can be naturally extended to integrate other cognitive domains, endophenotypes and genotypes.

  CSV Title: Vaccine-induced human antibodies specific for the third variable region of HIV-1 gp120 impose immune pressure on infecting viruses
  CSV Abstract: To evaluate the role of V3-specific IgG+ antibodies (Abs) in the RV144 clinical HIV vaccine trial, which reducedHIV-1 infection by 31.2%, the anti-V3 Ab response was assessed. Vaccinees' V3 Abs were highly cross-reactivewith cyclic V3 peptides (cV3s) from diverse virus subtypes. Sieve analysis of CRF01_AE breakthrough virusesfrom 43 vaccine- and 66 placebo-recipients demonstrated an estimated vaccine efficacy of 85% against viruseswith amino acids mismatching the vaccine at V3 site 317 (p= 0.004) and 52% against virusesmatching the vaccineat V3 site 307 (p = 0.004). This analysis was supported by data showing that vaccinees' plasma Abs wereless reactive with I307 when replaced with residues foundmore often in vaccinees' breakthrough viruses. Simultaneously, viruses with mutations at F317 were less infectious, possibly due to the contribution of F317 to optimalformation of the V3 hydrophobic core. These data suggest that RV144-induced V3-specific Abs imposed immunepressure on infecting viruses and inform efforts to design an HIV vaccine.

  CSV Title: Dopamine and memory dedifferentiation in aging
  CSV Abstract: The dedifferentiation theory of aging proposes that a reduction in the specificity of neural representations causes declines in complex cognition as people get older, and may reflect a reduction in dopaminergic signaling. The present pharmacological fMRI study investigated episodic memory-related dedifferentiation in young and older adults, and its relation to dopaminergic function, using a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind crossover design with the agonist Bromocriptine (1.25 mg) and the antagonist Sulpiride (400 mg). We used multi-voxel pattern analysis to measure memory specificity: the degree to which distributed patterns of activity distinguishing two different task contexts during an encoding phase are reinstated during memory retrieval. As predicted, memory specificity was reduced in older adults in prefrontal cortex and in hippocampus, consistent with an impact of neural dedifferentiation on episodic memory representations. There was also a linear age-dependent dopaminergic modulation of memory specificity in hippocampus reflecting a relative boost to memory specificity on Bromocriptine in older adults whose memory was poorer at baseline, and a relative boost on Sulpiride in older better performers, compared to the young. This differed from generalized effects of both agents on task specificity in the encoding phase. The results demonstrate a link between aging, dopaminergic function and dedifferentiation in the hippocampus.

  CSV Title: Analysis of negative historical control group data from the in vitro micronucleus assay using TK6 cells
  CSV Abstract: The recent revisions of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) genetic toxicology test guidelines emphasize the importance of historical negative controls both for data quality and interpretation. The goal of a HESI Genetic Toxicology Technical Committee (GTTC) workgroup was to collect data from participating laboratories and to conduct a statistical analysis to understand and publish the range of values that are normally seen in experienced laboratories using TK6 cells to conduct the in vitro micronucleus assay. Data from negative control samples from in vitro micronucleus assays using TK6 cells from 13 laboratories were collected using a standard collection form. Although in some cases statistically significant differences can be seen within laboratories for different test conditions, they were very small. The mean incidence of micronucleated cells/1000 cells ranged from 3.2/1000 to 13.8/1000. These almost four-fold differences in micronucleus levels cannot be explained by differences in scoring method, presence or absence of exogenous metabolic activation (S9), length of treatment, presence or absence of cytochalasin B or different solvents used as vehicles. The range of means from the four laboratories using flow cytometry methods (3.7-fold: 3.5–12.9 micronucleated cells/1000 cells) was similar to that from the nine laboratories using other scoring methods (4.3-fold: 3.2–13.8 micronucleated cells/1000 cells). No laboratory could be identified as an outlier or as showing unacceptably high variability. Quality Control (QC) methods applied to analyse the intra-laboratory variability showed that there was evidence of inter-experimental variability greater than would be expected by chance (i.e. over-dispersion). However, in general, this was low. This study demonstrates the value of QC methods in helping to analyse the reproducibility of results, building up a ‘normal’ range of values, and as an aid to identify variability within a laboratory in order to implement processes to maintain and improve uniformity.

  CSV Title: Near infra red spectroscopy as a multivariate process analytical tool for predicting pharmaceutical co-crystal concentration
  CSV Abstract: The use of near infra red spectroscopy to predict the concentration of two pharmaceutical co-crystals; 1:1 ibuprofen–nicotinamide (IBU-NIC) and 1:1 carbamazepine–nicotinamide (CBZ-NIC) has been evaluated. A partial least squares (PLS) regression model was developed for both co-crystal pairs using sets of standard samples to create calibration and validation data sets with which to build and validate the models. Parameters such as the root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC), root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and correlation coefficient were used to assess the accuracy and linearity of the models. Accurate PLS regression models were created for both co-crystal pairs which can be used to predict the co-crystal concentration in a powder mixture of the co-crystal and the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). The IBU-NIC model had smaller errors than the CBZ-NIC model, possibly due to the complex CBZ-NIC spectra which could reflect the different arrangement of hydrogen bonding associated with the co-crystal compared to the IBU-NIC co-crystal. These results suggest that NIR spectroscopy can be used as a PAT tool during a variety of pharmaceutical co-crystal manufacturing methods and the presented data will facilitate future offline and in-line NIR studies involving pharmaceutical co-crystals.

  CSV Title: Data article for adsorption of chemically activated fuller׳s earth and rice husk for removal of dri-marine reactive red dye
  CSV Abstract: Dyes are most commonly used in textile industries for colouring clothes. After colouring, dri-marine reactive red dye is drained into lakes and rivers, which is very hazardous for aquatic as well as human life. The treatment of this dye solution is necessary to make it clear before it is drained into river. For the treatment of this dye solution one of the cheapest and easy method is adsorption of dye with the natural adsorbents i.e. fuller׳s earth and rice husk. Data presented here focuses to improve the textural characteristics of both the adsorbents through chemical treatment. Selected chemicals for adsorbents treatment are acetic acid and sodium bicarbonate, both chemicals are very cheap, non-hazardous and never used before. Emphasis in this data article is to develop the easy and cost-effective method for removal of dri-marine reactive red dye.

  CSV Title: Chondroitinase gene therapy improves upper limb function following cervical contusion injury
  CSV Abstract: Chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are known to be important contributors to the intensely inhibitory environment that prevents tissue repair and regeneration following spinal cord injury. The bacterial enzyme chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) degrades these inhibitory molecules and has repeatedly been shown to promote functional recovery in a number of spinal cord injury models. However, when used to treat more traumatic and clinically relevant spinal contusion injuries, findings with the ChABC enzyme have been inconsistent. We recently demonstrated that delivery of mammalian-compatible ChABC via gene therapy led to sustained and widespread digestion of CSPGs, resulting in significant functional repair of a moderate thoracic contusion injury in adult rats. Here we demonstrate that chondroitinase gene therapy significantly enhances upper limb function following cervical contusion injury, with improved forelimb ladder performance and grip strength as well as increased spinal conduction through the injury site and reduced lesion pathology. This is an important addition to our previous findings as improving upper limb function is a top priority for spinal injured patients. Additionally great importance is placed on replication in the spinal cord injury field. That chondroitinase gene therapy has now been shown to be efficacious in contusion models at either thoracic or cervical level is an important step in the further development of this promising therapeutic strategy towards the clinic.

  CSV Title: The impact of recent and long-term experience on access to word meanings: Evidence from large-scale internet-based experiments
  CSV Abstract: Many word forms map onto multiple meanings (e.g., "ace"). The current experiments explore the extent to which adults reshape the lexical-semantic representations of such words on the basis of experience, to increase the availability of more recently accessed meanings. A naturalistic web-based experiment in which primes were presented within a radio programme (Experiment 1; N= 1800) and a lab-based experiment (Experiment 2) show that when listeners have encountered one or two disambiguated instances of an ambiguous word, they then retrieve this primed meaning more often (compared with an unprimed control condition). This word-meaning priming lasts up to 40. min after exposure, but decays very rapidly during this interval. Experiments 3 and 4 explore longer-term word-meaning priming by measuring the impact of more extended, naturalistic encounters with ambiguous words: recreational rowers (N= 213) retrieved rowing-related meanings for words (e.g., "feather") more often if they had rowed that day, despite a median delay of 8. hours. The rate of rowing-related interpretations also increased with additional years' rowing experience. Taken together these experiments show that individuals' overall meaning preferences reflect experience across a wide range of timescales from minutes to years. In addition, priming was not reduced by a change in speaker identity (Experiment 1), suggesting that the phenomenon occurs at a relatively abstract lexical-semantic level. The impact of experience was reduced for older adults (Experiments 1, 3, 4) suggesting that the lexical-semantic representations of younger listeners may be more malleable to current linguistic experience.

  CSV Title: Reconfiguration analysis of a 4-DOF 3-RER parallel manipulator with equilateral triangular base and moving platform
  CSV Abstract: This paper deals with the reconfiguration analysis of a 4-DOF (degrees-of-freedom) 3-RER parallel manipulator (PM) with equilateral triangular base and moving platform (ETBP), which is a special case of a 4-DOF PM in the literature. The 4-DOF 3-RER PM is composed of a base and a moving platform connected by three 3-RER legs, each of which is a serial kinematic chain composed of a revolute (R) joint, a planar (E) joint and an R joint in sequence. At first, a set of constraint equations of the 3-RER PM with ETBP is derived with the orientation of the moving platform represented using a Euler parameter quaternion (also Euler-Rodrigues quaternion) and then solved in closed form. It is found that the 3-RER PM with ETBP has three 4-DOF operation modes if both the base and moving platform are identical or two 4-DOF operation modes if the base and moving platform are not identical. The motion characteristics of the moving platform are obtained using the kinematic interpretation of Euler parameter quaternions with certain number of constant zero components, which was presented in a recent paper by the author of this paper. The transition configurations among different operation modes are also identified.

  CSV Title: Laser-driven ion acceleration: State of the art and emerging mechanisms
  CSV Abstract: Ion acceleration driven by high intensity laser pulses is attracting an impressive and steadily increasing research effort. Experiments over the past 10-15 years have demonstrated, over a wide range of laser and target parameters, the generation of multi-MeV proton and ion beams with unique properties, which have stimulated interest in a number of innovative applications. While most of this work has been based on sheath acceleration processes, where space-charge fields are established by relativistic electrons at surfaces of the irradiated target, a number of novel mechanisms has been the focus of recent theoretical and experimental activities. This paper will provide a brief review of the state of the art in the field of laser-driven ion acceleration, with particular attention to recent developments. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

  CSV Title: Role of growth factors and oxygen to limit hypertrophy and impact of high magnetic nanoparticles dose during stem cell chondrogenesis
  CSV Abstract: Due to an unmet clinical need of curative treatments for osteoarthritic patients, tissue engineering strategies that propose the development of cartilage tissue replacements from stem cells have emerged. Some of these strategies are based on the internalization of magnetic nanoparticles into stem cells to then initiate the chondrogenesis via magnetic compaction. A major difficulty is to drive the chondrogenic differentiation of the cells such as they produce an extracellular matrix free of hypertrophic collagen. An additional difficulty has to be overcome when nanoparticles are used, knowing that a high dose of nanoparticles can limit the chondrogenesis. We here propose a gene-based analysis of the effects of chemical factors (growth factors, hypoxia) on the chondrogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells both with and without nanoparticles. We focus on the synthesis of two of the most important constituents present in the cartilaginous extracellular matrix (Collagen II and Aggrecan) and on the expression of collagen X, the signature of hypertrophic cartilage, in order to provide a quantitative index of the type of cartilage produced (i.e. hyaline, hypertrophic). We demonstrate that by applying specific environmental conditions, gene expression can be directed toward the production of hyaline cartilage, with limited hypertrophy. Besides, a combination of the growth factors IGF-1, TGF-β3, with a hypoxic conditioning remarkably reduced the impact of high nanoparticles concentration.

  CSV Title: Social identity threats following the Fukushima nuclear accident and its influence on psychological distress
  CSV Abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of social identity on psychological distress in areas where residents had been evacuated to after the Fukushima nuclear accident. In a door-to-door survey, we surveyed 74 evacuees and 81 host community residents in a relocation area in Fukushima to evaluate whether social support mitigated evacuees’ and hosts’ distress and whether the social identity of each community affected distress. Social support mitigated distress in both evacuees and hosts. The construction and effect of social identity differed between groups: Evacuees had high original community (ingroup) identity, and their host community (outgroup) identity decreased their distress. Hosts had high host community (ingroup) identity but low evacuee community (outgroup) identity. Hosts with high ingroup identity who integrated outgroup identity had increased distress. These results suggest that management of social identity in addition to social support is important for mitigating psychological distress after the nuclear accident, and that support for individuals should be focused on management of both host and evacuee communities in relocation areas.

  CSV Title: Comparison of steady-state and transient thermal conductivity testing methods using different industrial rubber compounds
  CSV Abstract: Reliable material data, especially of the thermal conductivity as a function of temperature, are crucial for the virtual optimization of the rubber injection molding process. Due to the low thermal conductivity of rubber compounds, typically in the range from 0.15 to 0.4 W m−1K−1, and the fact that the molding of the rubber part takes place in a heated mold via an energy-based crosslinking reaction, the total cycle time is in the range of minutes. Consequently, there is a vast potential for optimization of this lengthy production cycle. To determine the thermal conductivity of seven different rubber compounds, a stationary (Guarded Heat Flow Meter (GHF)), and three transient methods (Plane-Source (TPS), Line-Source (TLS), and Laser Flash Analysis (LFA)) were employed. Ancillary, the anisotropic TPS- and the LFA-method require the material parameters specific heat capacity as well as density. The TPS method also offers the possibility to perform an isotropic and an anisotropic measurement of the thermal conductivity. In general, filled rubber systems do not exhibit an isotropic material behavior. Due to filler orientation or diffusion of volatile substances to the surface, the values of the thermal conductivity obtained from TPS-method differ significantly from those of GHF or LFA. The TLS-measured thermal conductivity coincide with the GHF results; however, TLS is limited to rubber compounds containing no cross-linking system, and it is sensitive to emitted volatile substances. To conclude, both the GHF- and the LFA-method provide comparable results for all seven tested rubber compounds.

  CSV Title: An Overview of the Smart Grid in Great Britain
  CSV Abstract: This paper presents an overview of the current status of the development of the smart grid in Great Britain (GB). The definition, policy and technical drivers, incentive mechanisms, technological focus, and the industry's progress in developing the smart grid are described. In particular, the Low Carbon Networks Fund and Electricity Network Innovation Competition projects, together with the rollout of smart metering, are detailed. A more observable, controllable, automated, and integrated electricity network will be supported by these investments in conjunction with smart meter installation. It is found that the focus has mainly been on distribution networks as well as on real-time flows of information and interaction between suppliers and consumers facilitated by improved information and communications technology, active power flow management, demand management, and energy storage. The learning from the GB smart grid initiatives will provide valuable guidelines for future smart grid development in GB and other countries.

  CSV Title: The Emergy Perspective of Sustainable Trends in Puerto Rico From 1960 to 2013
  CSV Abstract: Emergy analysis quantifies the direct and indirect contributions of nature to human systems providing a sustainability assessment framework, which couples economic growth within biophysical constraints. In this study, Puerto Rico's sustainability was assessed with emergy flow dynamics from 1960 to 2013. During this period, the island shifted from an agriculture-based economy to an industrial base of manufacture and services (1960–1970). The emergy analysis indicated an exponential decline in sustainability during this period. From 1975 to 1992, the island became more industrialized and imported more goods and services. Since 1998, although more renewable production such as forest regeneration occurred, the rapid industrialization heavily relied on imported fossil fuels, goods, and services, resulting in a system that has not been self-sufficient, nor sustainable. The latest economic crisis and the most recently passed financial rescue bill represent an opportunity to redirect Puerto Rico towards a sustainable path with policies that decrease the ratio of imported y to exported emergy, and strategies that encourage efficient use of resources and local production based on the utilization of renewable sources within this U.S. territory.

  CSV Title: Internet-based intervention for smoking cessation (StopAdvisor) in people with low and high socioeconomic status: A randomised controlled trial
  CSV Abstract: Background: Internet-based interventions for smoking cessation could help millions of people stop smoking at very low unit costs; however, long-term biochemically verified evidence is scarce and such interventions might be less effective for smokers with low socioeconomic status than for those with high status because of lower online literacy to engage with websites. We aimed to assess a new interactive internet-based intervention (StopAdvisor) for smoking cessation that was designed with particular attention directed to people with low socioeconomic status. Methods: We did this online randomised controlled trial between Dec 6, 2011, and Oct 11, 2013, in the UK. Participants aged 18 years and older who smoked every day were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive treatment with StopAdvisor or an information-only website. Randomisation was automated with an unseen random number function embedded in the website to establish which treatment was revealed after the online baseline assessment. Recruitment continued until the required sample size had been achieved from both high and low socioeconomic status subpopulations. Participants, and researchers who obtained data and did laboratory analyses, were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was 6 month sustained, biochemically verified abstinence. The main secondary outcome was 6 month, 7 day biochemically verified point prevalence. Analysis was by intention to treat. Homogeneity of intervention effect across the socioeconomic subsamples was first assessed to establish whether overall or separate subsample analyses were appropriate. The study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN99820519. Findings: We randomly assigned 4613 participants to the StopAdvisor group (n=2321) or the control group (n=2292); 2142 participants were of low socioeconomic status and 2471 participants were of high status. The overall rate of smoking cessation was similar between participants in the StopAdvisor and control groups for the primary (237 [10%] vs 220 [10%] participants; relative risk [RR] 1·06, 95% CI 0·89-1·27; p=0·49) and the secondary (358 [15%] vs 332 [15%] participants; 1·06, 0·93-1·22; p=0·37) outcomes; however, the intervention effect differed across socioeconomic status subsamples (1·44, 0·99-2·09; p=0·0562 and 1·37, 1·02-1·84; p=0·0360, respectively). StopAdvisor helped participants with low socioeconomic status stop smoking compared with the information-only website (primary outcome: 90 [8%] of 1088 vs 64 [6%] of 1054 participants; RR 1·36, 95% CI 1·00-1·86; p=0·0499; secondary outcome: 136 [13%] vs 100 [10%] participants; 1·32, 1·03-1·68, p=0·0267), but did not improve cessation rates in those with high socioeconomic status (147 [12%] of 1233 vs 156 [13%] of 1238 participants; 0·95, 0·77-1·17; p=0·61 and 222 [18%] vs 232 [19%] participants; 0·96, 0·81-1·13, p=0·64, respectively). Interpretation: StopAdvisor was more effective than an information-only website in smokers of low, but not high, socioeconomic status. StopAdvisor could be implemented easily and made freely available, which would probably improve the success rates of smokers with low socioeconomic status who are seeking online support.

  CSV Title: Hyperosmolar dehydration: A predictor of kidney injury and outcome in hospitalised older adults
  CSV Abstract: Background & aims: Hospitalised older adults are vulnerable to dehydration. However, the prevalence of hyperosmolar dehydration (HD) and its impact on outcome is unknown. Serum osmolality is not measured routinely but osmolarity, a validated alternative, can be calculated using routinely measured serum biochemistry. This study aimed to use calculated osmolarity to measure the prevalence of HD (serum osmolarity >300 mOsm/l) and assess its impact on acute kidney injury (AKI) and outcome in hospitalised older adults. Methods: This retrospective cohort study used data from a UK teaching hospital retrieved from the electronic database relating to all medical emergency admissions of patients aged ≥ 65 years admitted between 1st May 2011 and 31st October 2013. Using these data, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), National Early Warning Score (NEWS), length of hospital stay (LOS) and mortality were determined. Osmolarity was calculated using the equation of Krahn and Khajuria. Results: A total of 6632 patients were identified; 27% had HD, 39% of whom had AKI. HD was associated with a median (Q1, Q3) LOS of 5 (1, 12) days compared with 3 (1, 9) days in the euhydrated group, P < 0.001. Adjusted Cox-regression analysis demonstrated that patients with HD were four-times more likely to develop AKI 12–24 h after admission [Hazards Ratio (95% Confidence Interval) 4.5 (3.5–5.6), P < 0.001], and had 60% greater 30-day mortality [1.6 (1.4–1.9), P < 0.001], compared with those who were euhydrated. Conclusion: HD is common in hospitalised older adults and is associated with increased LOS, risk of AKI and mortality. Further work is required to assess the validity of osmolality or osmolarity as an early predictor of AKI and the impact of HD on outcome prospectively.

  CSV Title: Behaviour and strength assessment of masonry prisms
  CSV Abstract: This is a case study presenting the cracking behavior and assessment of the compressive strength of masonry prisms. The compressive strength of masonry was determined by performing laboratory tests on 192 masonry prism specimens corresponding to 3 specimens each in 64 groups. The variables considered in the experimental program are type of brick, strength of masonry and height-to-thickness (h/t) ratio of the prism specimen. Pressed earth bricks and burnt clay bricks were used for the preparation of masonry prisms. A mathematical model is also proposed for the estimation of compressive strength of masonry prisms by performing a statistical multiple regression analysis on 232 data sets, which includes 64 test data from the present study and 168 test data published in the literature. The model was developed based on the regression analysis of test data of prisms made of a variety of masonry units namely clay bricks, pressed earth bricks, concrete blocks, calcium silicate bricks, stone blocks, perforated bricks and soft mud bricks. The proposed model not only accounts for the wide ranges of compressive strengths of masonry unit and mortar, but also accounts for the influence of volume fractions of masonry unit and mortar in addition to the height-to-thickness ratio. The predicted compressive strength of prisms using the proposed model is compared with 14 models available in published literature. The predicted strength was found to be in good agreement with the corresponding experimental data.

  CSV Title: On the status of orbital high-resolution repeat imaging of Mars for the observation of dynamic surface processes
  CSV Abstract: This work deals with the meta-data analysis of high-resolution orbital imagery that was acquired over the last four decades of Mars. The objective of this analysis is to provide a starting point for planetary scientists who are interested in examining the martian surface in order to detect changes that are related to not fully understood natural phenomena. An image aggregation method is introduced and used to generate image groupings related to prioritising regions for change detection. The parameters determining each grouping are the season, the Martian Year and the local time that an image was acquired, the imaging instrument and its resolution. The analysis shows that there is sufficient coverage to systematically examine periodic martian phenomena in images that depict the same area over the same season, as well as sporadic martian phenomena (e.g. a new crater) in images that depict the same area in different time periods. The end product of this work is a series of 35 global coverage maps demonstrating the high-resolution repeat coverage of Mars up to Martian Year 31 under different temporal and viewing condition constraints. These are available both through supplementary material as well as via a web-GIS.1.

  CSV Title: Individual Neuronal Subtypes Exhibit Diversity in CNS Myelination Mediated by Synaptic Vesicle Release
  CSV Abstract: Regulation of myelination by oligodendrocytes in the CNS has important consequences for higher-order nervous system function (e.g., [1–4]), and there is growing consensus that neuronal activity regulates CNS myelination (e.g., [5–9]) through local axon-oligodendrocyte synaptic-vesicle-release-mediated signaling [10–12]. Recent analyses have indicated that myelination along axons of distinct neuronal subtypes can differ [13, 14], but it is not known whether regulation of myelination by activity is common to all neuronal subtypes or only some. This limits insight into how specific neurons regulate their own conduction. Here, we use a novel fluorescent fusion protein reporter to study myelination along the axons of distinct neuronal subtypes over time in zebrafish. We find that the axons of reticulospinal and commissural primary ascending (CoPA) neurons are among the first myelinated in the zebrafish CNS. To investigate how activity regulates myelination by different neuronal subtypes, we express tetanus toxin (TeNT) in individual reticulospinal or CoPA neurons to prevent synaptic vesicle release. We find that the axons of individual tetanus toxin expressing reticulospinal neurons have fewer myelin sheaths than controls and that their myelin sheaths are 50% shorter than controls. In stark contrast, myelination along tetanus-toxin-expressing CoPA neuron axons is entirely normal. These results indicate that while some neuronal subtypes modulate myelination by synaptic vesicle release to a striking degree in vivo, others do not. These data have implications for our understanding of how different neurons regulate myelination and thus their own function within specific neuronal circuits.

  CSV Title: Identification of miRNAs contributing to neuroblastoma chemoresistance
  CSV Abstract: Background The emergence of the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in exacerbating drug resistance of tumours is recently being highlighted as a crucial research field for future clinical management of drug resistant tumours. The purpose of this study was to identify dys-regulations in expression of individual and/or networks of miRNAs that may have direct effect on neuroblastoma (NB) drug resistance. Methods Individual subcultures of chemosensitive SH-SY5Y and UKF-NB-3 cells were rendered chemoresistant to doxorubicin (SH-SY5Y, UKF-NB-3) or etoposide (SH-SY5Y). In each validated chemoresistance model, the parental and subcultured cell lines were analysed for miRNA expression profiling, using a high-throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) miRNA profiling platform for a total of 668 miRNAs. Results A unique expression signature of miRNAs was found to be differentially expressed (higher than 2-fold change) within all three NB chemoresistance models. Four miRNAs were upregulated in the subcultured chemoresistant cell line. Three miRNAs were found to be downregulated in the chemoresistant cell lines for all models. Conclusions Based on the initial miRNA findings, this study elucidates the dys-regulation of four miRNAs in three separate NB chemoresistant cell line models, spanning two cell lines (SH-SY5Y and UKF-NB-3) and two chemotherapeutic agents (doxorubicin and etoposide). These miRNAs may thus be possibly linked to chemoresistance induction in NB. Such miRNAs are good candidates to be novel drug targets for future miRNA based therapies against aggressive tumours that are not responding to conventional chemotherapy.

  CSV Title: Enhanced nutritional value of chickpea protein concentrate by dry separation and solid state fermentation
  CSV Abstract: A sustainable dry processing method to obtain nutritional and functional chickpea products was developed, yielding protein concentrates suited to prepare products without additives. Chickpeas were milled and air-classified into protein and starch-enriched concentrates. Subsequently, spontaneous solid state fermentation (SSF) with daily back-slopping was performed at 37 °C. The dominant autochthonous lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains in chickpea flour and enriched fractions were Pediococcus pentosaceus and Pediococcus acidilactici. Strains were selected on their ability to metabolise flatulence-causing α-galactosides. SSF reduced the pH of the doughs in 24h from 6.6 to 4.2. After 72 h, concentrations of raffinose and stachyose were reduced by 88.3–99.1%, while verbascose became undetectable. Moreover, phytic acid reduced with 17% while total phenolic contents increased with 119%. Besides the observed differences in smell, texture and colour, the sourdoughs showed 67% higher water-holding capacity. This natural route to produce chickpea concentrates thus increases both the nutritive and technical functionality. Industrial relevance Increasing the sustainability of our food production is required to meet the demand for food of our growing world population. A processing route combining dry fractionation and solid state fermentation is developed to prepare chickpea concentrates with improved nutritional properties. This route is more sustainable as the use of water and thus energy-intensive drying steps are minimised. Moreover, it provides more natural ‘clean-label’ foods, i.e., foods with less additives and minimally processed. Solid state fermentation is used to reduce the presence of anti-nutritional factors, i.e., α-galactosides and phytic acid. Autochthonous LAB were accumulated via back-slopping and employed as starter culture as an alternative to the use of a commercial starter culture. Chickpea sourdoughs with enhanced nutritional quality of chickpea were obtained. The sourdough may be used directly to fortify cereal products like chickpea protein enriched bread or can be dried into a chickpea ingredient for many other applications as well.

  CSV Title: H2O2 rejuvenation-mediated synthesis of stable mixed-morphology Ag3PO4 photocatalysts
  CSV Abstract: Ag3PO4 photocatalyst has attracted interest of the scientific community in recent times due to its reported high efficiency for water oxidation and dye degradation. However, Ag3PO4 photo-corrodes if electron accepter such as AgNO3 is not used as scavenger. Synthesis of efficient Ag3PO4 followed by a simple protocol for regeneration of the photocatalyst is therefore a prerequisite for practical application. Herein, we present a facile method for the synthesis of a highly efficient Ag3PO4, whose photocatalytic efficiency was demonstrated using 3 different organic dyes: Methylene Blue (MB), Methyl orange (MO) and Rhodamine B (RhB) organic dyes for degradation tests. Approximately, 19 % of Ag3PO4 is converted to Ag0 after 4.30 hours of continuous UV-Vis irradiation in presence of MB organic dye. We have shown that the Ag/Ag3PO4 composite can be rejuvenated by a simple chemical oxidation step after several cycles of photocatalysis tests. At an optimal pH of 6.5, a mixture of cubic, rhombic dodecahedron, nanosphere and nanocrystals morphologies of the photocatalyst was formed. H2O2 served as the chemical oxidant to re-insert the surface metallic Ag into the Ag3PO4 photocatalyst but also as the agent that can control morphology of the regenerated as-prepared photocatalyst without the need for any other morphology controlling Agent (MCA). Surprisingly, the as- regenerated Ag3PO4 was found to have higher photocatalytic reactivity than the freshly made material and superior at least 17 times in comparison with the conventional Degussa TiO2, and some of TiO2 composites tested in this work.

  CSV Title: The need to incorporate fast and slow relaxation kinetic parameters into photosynthesis-measuring systems
  CSV Abstract: Increasing global population demands the doubling of crop production by 2050. Advancements in agricultural techniques make it possible to increase the rate of crop improvement, though utilization of molecular tools to identify traits related to yield and stress tolerance is poor. The development of effective physiological selection criteria that are fast and non-destructive, particularly those related to yield and stress tolerance, will help in developing improved crop cultivars. In plant stress physiology, established chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, such as the efficiency of photosystem II (ФPSII), photosystem I electron transport rate (PSI ETR), and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), have received attention. The photoprotective processes conferred by NPQ serve fundamental roles in maintaining plant fitness and sustainable yields where their importance in predicting crop performance and yield under normal or stressful environments has been widely recognized. In this review, we focus on two informative parameters, - qE and qI,- which are components of NPQ that have been ignored by most photosynthesis-measuring systems. We argue for adding these parameters to photosynthesis machines as calculating them later can be cumbersome and their inclusion will help plant breeders and non-specialists in phenotyping using chlorophyll fluorescence.

  CSV Title: Improving cognitive control in adolescents with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
  CSV Abstract: The adverse impact of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on the developing mind in adolescence can extend well into adulthood. The developmental malleability of cognitive control capacity in this age group, however, may hold particular promise for cognitive training interventions. The present study investigated the effects of affective working memory (aWMT) compared to placebo-training on cognitive and affective functioning in adolescents with PTSD. 30 treatment-seeking adolescents trained for 20 days on either an affective dual n-back task (aWMT; n = 15) or a feature match task (placebo; n = 15). The aWMT group showed greater pre-to post-training increases in cognitive control as measured by the GoNogo task as well as improvements in symptoms of PTSD and increased use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies. These preliminary findings are promising given the potential for free and easy dissemination of the aWMT in schools and online.

  CSV Title: Cryo-analytical STEM of frozen, aqueous dispersions of nanoparticles
  CSV Abstract:  In situ characterisation of nanoparticle dispersion and surface coatings is required to further our understanding of the behaviour of nanoparticles in aqueous suspension. Using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) it is possible to analyse a nanoparticle suspension in the frozen, hydrated state; however, this analysis is often limited to imaging alone. This work demonstrates the first use of analytical scanning TEM (STEM) in the examination of nanoparticles captured in a layer of vitreous ice. Imaging and analysis of frozen hydrated suspensions by both STEM energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) under cryogenic conditions demonstrates the identification and separation of CeO 2 , Fe 2 O 3 , ZnO and Ag nanoparticles in suspension. Damage caused by the electron beam was shown to occur at far higher electron fluences in STEM (<2000 e − /Å 2 ) compared to CTEM (<100 e − /Å 2 ) due to diffusion limited damage by the radiolysis products generated in vitreous ice. Further application of cryo-analytical STEM was undertaken on barium titanate biomarker nanoparticles dispersed in cell culture media to show the formation of a Ca and P rich coating around the nanoparticles when suspended in the media. This previously unreported coating changes the surface chemistry of the biomarkers when exposed to cells. Thus we show that the technique has the potential to advance our understanding of the fundamental behaviour of nanoparticles in complex aqueous suspensions.

  CSV Title: Clinical applications of population pharmacokinetic models of antibiotics: Challenges and perspectives
  CSV Abstract: Because of increasing antimicrobial resistance and the shortage of new antibiotics, there is a growing need to optimize the use of old and new antibiotics. Modelling of the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) characteristics of antibiotics can support the optimization of dosing regimens. Antimicrobial efficacy is determined by susceptibility of the drug to the microorganism and exposure to the drug, which relies on the PK and the dose. Population PK models describe relationships between patients characteristics and drug exposure. This article highlights three clinical applications of these models applied to antibiotics: 1) dosing evaluation of old antibiotics, 2) setting clinical breakpoints and 3) dosing individualization using therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). For each clinical application, challenges regarding interpretation are discussed. An important challenge is to improve the understanding of the interpretation of modelling results for good implementation of the dosing recommendations, clinical breakpoints and TDM advices. Therefore, also background information on PK/PD principles and approaches to analyse PK/PD data are provided.

  CSV Title: The prevalence, patterns, and correlates of gambling behaviours in men: An exploratory study from Goa, India
  CSV Abstract: Background: There is a significant evidence gap on gambling in India, where gambling is viewed predominantly through the legal lens. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence, patterns, and correlates of gambling. Methods: Cross-sectional data from the follow-up assessment in a cohort (n = 1514 men)from India. The following data were collected using a structured questionnaire: socio-demographic information, gambling, interpersonal violence, tobacco use, alcohol use disorders (AUD), common mental disorders, and suicidality. Logistic regression models were used to examine the correlates of gambling. Results: 658 participants (45.4%)reported gambling in the past year, and lottery was the most frequent form of gambling (67.8%). Current gambling was correlated with rural residence (OR 1.42, CI 1.05–1.93, p = 0.02), work-related problems (OR 1.42, CI 1.03–1.96, p = 0.03), interpersonal violence (OR 3.45, CI 1.22–9.75, p = 0.02), tobacco use (OR 1.59, CI 1.16–2.19, p = 0.004), and AUD (OR 2.14, CI 1.35–3.41, p = 0.001). 724 (49.9%)participants reported gambling at least once in their lifetime. Lifetime gambling was correlated with work-related problems (OR 1.57, CI 1.14–2.17, p = 0.006), interpersonal violence (OR 4.03, CI 1.32–12.30 p = 0.02), tobacco use (OR 1.60, CI 1.16–2.20, p = 0.004), and AUD (OR 2.12, CI 1.33–3.40, p = 0.002). Age was significantly associated with playing lottery more frequently (OR 3.24, CI 1.34–7.84, p = 0.009)and tobacco use was significantly associated with playing matka more frequently (OR 1.69, CI 1.08–2.64, p = 0.02). Discussion: The high prevalence of gambling and its association with social problems and risk factors for non-communicable diseases warrants further epidemiological research.

  CSV Title: An end-user perspective on Organ-on-a-Chip: Assays and usability aspects
  CSV Abstract: The field of Organ-on-a-Chip is rapidly shifting from academic proof-of-concept studies to real-world solutions. The challenge is now to enhance end-user adoption by improving user friendliness, compatibility, assay ability and product readiness of these solutions. This review evaluates Organ-on-a-Chip efforts published over the last two years in light of such end-user adoption aspects. Elegant platforms have been reported including a microtiter plate-based 3D cell culture platform and a platform of cantilevers with integrated gauge sensors for contractility measurement. Also functional assays for angiogenesis, calcium imaging of neurons and neuro-muscular contractility were reported. Compatibility with standard analysis techniques such as sequencing, fluorescent activated cell sorting and mass spectrometry were reported only in rare cases. It is concluded that the elements that enable the leap towards end-user adoption are in place, but only few systems have managed to incorporate all aspects, and are able to answer biological questions.

Using a new panel of UK inventors this paper provides an analysis of associations between these 'proximities' and co-patenting. The results show that while collaboration within firms, research centres and universities remains crucial, external networks of inventors are key feature of innovation teams. The analysis shows that external networks are highly dependent on previous social connections, but are generally unconstrained by cultural or cognitive factors. Geographical proximity is also weakly linked with external networks. Our results suggest that innovation policies should, rather than focus on spatial clustering, facilitate the formation of open and diverse networks of inventors.

  CSV Title: Unraveling the intricate biodiversity of the benthic harpacticoid genus Nannopus (Copepoda, Harpacticoida, Nannopodidae) in Korean waters
  CSV Abstract: Nannopus (Harpacticoida, Nannopodidae) species are abundant and widely distributed throughout the world across a variety of habitats. Nannopus is well known for high frequencies of misidentifications and thus may comprise several cryptic complexes and morphologically distinct species. Cryptic taxa are common in meiofauna communities. In this study, we aimed to identify Nannopus species using an integrative approach including molecular taxonomy. We adopted a non-destructive DNA extraction method so that morphological and molecular data could be obtained from the same specimen. We analyzed the molecular diversity and distributions of Nannopus using a total of 190 individuals. We sequenced the 190 mtCOI, 53 mtCYTB, 25 18SrDNA, and 43 28SrDNA genes from 190 individuals. Several species delimitation approaches were applied, including uncorrected p-distances for mtCOI, mtCYTB, 18SrDNA, and 28SrDNA, and Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery and Bayesian implemented Poisson tree processes for mtCOI and mtCYTB data. The maximum likelihood and Bayesian approaches were used to examine the phylogenetic relationships among individuals using the combined set of all four genes. Our species delimitation and phylogenetic analyses indicated the presence of three cryptic and six morphologically distinct species. All species are sympatric and widely distributed across mudflats ranging from the Yellow Sea to the South Sea in Korea. The divergence patterns of the four genes were not congruent. A phylogenetic tree based on the concatenated dataset was the most robust, was congruent with morphology, and suggested two major clades. We considered the validity of reinstating the genus Ilyophilus (Lilljeborg, 1902) and ultimately concluded that including all congeners in Nannopus until the type species (N. palustris Brady, 1880) is re-described was the most prudent approach.

  CSV Title: Changes in living arrangements and mortality among older people in China
  CSV Abstract: Living arrangements in later life are dynamic, with changes associated with life events such as widowhood or moves into an institution. Previous research has found particular changes in living arrangements to be associated with an elevated risk of mortality. However, research in this area within the context of China is limited, despite China being home to the world's largest population of older people. This study investigates the impact of changes in living arrangements on older persons’ survival using the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey from 2002 to 2011. The original sample was 16,064 in 2002, and this study includes 6191 individuals who survived in 2005 and had complete information of track record in later waves. Changes in living arrangements are examined between 2002 and 2005. Cox-proportional hazards models are then used to investigate the association between the dynamics of living arrangements and respondents’ survival status from 2005 to 2011. Results show that men and women who lived in an institution in both 2002 and 2005, or who moved into an institution from living with family faced a greater risk of dying compared to those continuing to live with family. By contrast, continuing to live with family or alone, or moving between living with family and living alone, were not associated with an increased mortality risk, although there were some differences by gender. The institutional care sector in China is still in its infancy, with provision based on ability to pay market fees rather than need associated with age-related function impairment. The findings show that living in, or moving into, an institution is associated with a high mortality risk therefore requires further investigation in the context of a rapidly changing Chinese society.

  CSV Title: Alkylphenolic compounds and risk of breast and prostate cancer in the MCC-Spain study
  CSV Abstract: Background: Alkylphenolic compounds are chemicals with endocrine disrupting properties that have been widely used in industry with important changes in their usage over time. Few epidemiologic studies have evaluated the effect of alkylphenolic compounds on human health. Objectives: We investigated whether occupational exposure to alkylphenolic compounds is associated with breast and prostate cancer. Methods: We carried out a population-based case–control study including 1513 incident cases of breast cancer, 1095 of prostate cancer, and 3055 controls, frequency matched by sex, age and region. Occupational exposure to alkylphenolic compounds was estimated using a recently developed job-exposure matrix, which considered different scenarios of exposure and different subtypes of alkylphenolic compounds. Results: History of occupational exposure to alkylphenolic compounds was modestly associated with breast cancer (OR = 1.23; 95% CI = 1.01–1.48). Within the different scenarios, the occupational use of domestic tensioactives was positively associated with breast cancer (OR = 1.28; 95% CI = 1.02–1.60), while occupational exposure in other scenarios showed mostly a suggestion of a similar positive associations. Exposure to nonylphenol ethoxylates was positively associated with breast cancer (OR = 1.21; 95% CI = 1.00–1.47), while exposure to other compounds was uncommon. In general, we did not observe associations between alkylphenolic compounds and prostate cancer, except for a positive association among men occupationally exposed to cosmetic, hair and personal hygiene products. Conclusions: Our findings suggest a modest association between breast cancer risk and occupational exposure to alkylphenolic compounds, and no associations between these compounds and prostate cancer risk. These findings warrant further corroboration in other studies.

  CSV Title: Stress concentrations around voids in three dimensions: The roots of failure
  CSV Abstract: We present stress concentration factors at the edges of 3D voids in uniaxial compression. Variations in these stress concentration factors due to Poisson's ratio of the host material, void shape, and void-void proximity are explicitly quantified. Voids loaded by a vertical compressive stress are hypothesised to fail in one or two ways: (1) tension crack development due to tensile stress concentrations at the void poles; or (2) compressive stress concentrations at the void sides causing the void wall to fail in shear. The stress concentration factors in this study are found using the numerical displacement discontinuity method. Equations are provided to assess the proximity of a void to the two hypothesised modes of failure. For 3D voids thinned in an axis that lies parallel to the compressive stress these have increasingly high stress concentrations at their sides. Changes in stress concentrations due to the Poisson's ratio of the matrix are minor, apart from for the intermediate stress at the void sides. Void shape, void separation, and void alignment are critical factors in the concentration of stresses. This suggests a significant departure from strength predictions for porous material that are based solely on scalar values of porosity.

  CSV Title: Trials of the killed oral cholera vaccine (Shanchol) in India and Bangladesh: Lessons learned and way forward
  CSV Abstract: Cholera has been endemic in India and Bangladesh for the greater part of recorded history, giving this region the reputation of being the ‘homeland of cholera’. The causative organism Vibrio cholerae O1 has been responsible for large epidemics and pandemics. Bangladesh and India have conducted several sequential studies of Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) to ascertain its safety, efficacy, effectiveness, field feasibility and acceptance in high-risk urban populations. The objective of this article is to illustrate the experience of OCV use in these endemic settings, its major challenges, and how policymakers can grant vaccine licenses as well as implement its use in the national immunization programme. The relevant aspects of the OCV studies, such as boosting the effect of vaccine, single-dose versus double-dose trials and thermal stability of the vaccine during delivery have generated strong evidence for recommendation of vaccine use in these settings. Studies have shown that a single dose is effective for children of five years of age and older age groups. The locally manufactured vaccine in India is thermostable and can be delivered in field settings without use of cold chain. The vaccine delivery is feasible and the protective efficacy (PE) of this vaccine above five years of age against cholera was 53–65%. Administration of an OCV boosting regimen elicits an immune response similar to those who received a two-dose vaccine five years back. OCV can be used as a preemptive measure in endemic settings, in natural calamities and during political instability when there is total disruption as well as collapse of safe water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities and other control measures. Clear identification of areas and target population (who will gain benefit from the OCVs) is required to be developed in endemic settings.

  CSV Title: Farmers’ perception of effective drought policy implementation: A case study of 2009–2010 drought in Yunnan province, China
  CSV Abstract: Using a qualitative social research method at the local administrative level, this paper provides insight into the policy process in China and farmers’ perceptions of the effectiveness of policies implemented to deal with drought. Two villages in rural South-West Yunnan were purposefully selected for the study. The research started with the general assumption that China has a strong top-down hierarchal approach to policy processes and that funding dispersal is prioritised by the central government. However, the study found that funding proposals are prioritised for selection in a bottom-up, participatory manner from the local level. The study also found that farmers’ perceptions of the effectiveness of policy implementation were directly related to their past experience. Among the nine indicators used to measure the effectiveness of policy implementation at the local level, the farmers in the study area perceived access to roads as highly effective; water use efficiency projects, market demand, human mobility for jobs, and government funds as moderately effective; drought knowledge, community participation in planning, and governance structures as least effective; and the role of leadership as not effective. The study found that farmers’ adaptation at the local level is oriented towards short-term market rewards and income diversification. Farmers’ local-level adaptation is guided by government priorities and driven by their perception of tangible benefits. To ensure the effectiveness of policy implementation, long-term adaptation strategies, such as awareness raising, capacity building, watershed management, and source conservation need to be strengthened at the local level.

  CSV Abstract: Plastic pollution in oceans and rivers is of high concern because of its persistence in the environment and its potential impact on ecosystems. However, there is a specific lack of data in rivers. Here we present data from the Seine river banks in a historical polluted shore. Data were classified using international MSFD and OSPAR classifications. The sampled site is a quadrat of 1 m2 located downstream in the estuary in a visual maximum along a 1 km shore covered by plastics. A total of 20,259 plastic debris were individually counted, classified and weighted by category for a total mass higher than 4 kg. Half of the plastic debris in number are represented by preproduction pellets.

  CSV Title: An integrated clinicoradiological staging system for pulmonary sarcoidosis: A case-cohort study
  CSV Abstract: Background: Mortality in pulmonary sarcoidosis is highly variable and a reliable prognostic algorithm for disease staging and for guiding management decisions is needed. The objective of this study is to derive and test a staging system for determining prognosis in pulmonary sarcoidosis. Methods: We identified the prognostic value of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) patterns and pulmonary function tests, including the composite physiological index (CPI) in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. We integrated prognostic physiological and HRCT variables to form a clinical staging algorithm predictive of mortality in a test cohort. The staging system was externally validated in a separate cohort by the same methods of discrimination used in the primary analysis and tested for clinical applicability by four test observers. Findings: The test cohort included 251 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis in the study referred to the Sarcoidosis clinic at the Royal Brompton Hospital, UK, between Jan 1, 2000, and June 30, 2010. The CPI was the strongest predictor of mortality (HR 1·04, 95% CI 1·02-1·06, p<0·0001) in the test cohort. An optimal CPI threshold of 40 units was identified (HR 4·24, 2·84-6·33, p<0·0001). The CPI40, main pulmonary artery diameter to ascending aorta diameter ratio (MPAD/AAD), and an extent of fibrosis threshold of 20% were combined to form a staging algorithm. When assessed in the validation cohort (n=252), this staging system was strikingly more predictive of mortality than any individual variable alone (HR 5·89, 2·68-10·08, p<0·0001). The staging system was successfully applied to the test and validation cohorts combined, by two radiologists and two physicians. Interpretation: A clear prognostic separation of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis is provided by a simple staging system integrating the CPI and two HRCT variables.

  CSV Title: Inattention and distraction in fatal road crashes – Results from in-depth crash investigations in Norway
  CSV Abstract: Distraction and inattention pose a considerable threat to road safety, not only for car drivers, but also for vulnerable road users. Previous studies show that inattention and distraction are more often contributing factors in severe crashes, compared to less severe crashes. The correlation with severity appears to vary with the type of inattention. The aim of the present study was to conduct a comprehensive mapping of the types of inattention that contribute to fatal road crashes. This was done by exploring data from in-depth investigations of all fatal road crashes in Norway between 2011 and 2015 conducted by crash investigation teams of the Norwegian Public Roads Administration. Crash reports were selected for screening, based on codes indicating inattention as a possible contributing factor. Inattention among at-fault drivers of motor vehicles was found to contribute to almost one out of three fatal road crashes between 2011 and 2015. About one-third of inattention-related crashes involved pedestrians who were hit by motor vehicles, where the driver typically detected the pedestrian too late. Failure to check for information in blind spots or behind other sight obstructions is a typical form of inattention. Distraction by use of mobile phones contributed to between two and four percent of all fatal crashes, while other sources of distraction, within or outside of the vehicle, contributed to about ten percent. Driver inattention may be preventable by a system-oriented approach including a combination of vehicle technology, road and road environment improvements, appropriate signs and markings, education and information, as well as legal measures and enforcement regarding use of mobile phones, in-vehicle sight obstructions, and involvement in other secondary tasks during driving.

  CSV Title: Associations between a fetal imprinted gene allele score and late pregnancy maternal glucose concentrations
  CSV Abstract: Aim We hypothesised that some of the genetic risk for gestational diabetes (GDM) is due to the fetal genome affecting maternal glucose concentrations. Previously, we found associations between fetal IGF2 gene variants and maternal glucose concentrations in late pregnancy. Methods In the present study, we tested associations between SNP alleles from 15 fetal imprinted genes and maternal glucose concentrations in late pregnancy in the Cambridge Baby Growth and Wellbeing cohorts (1160 DNA trios). Results Four fetal SNP alleles with the strongest univariate associations: paternally-transmitted IGF2 rs10770125 (P-value = 2 × 10–4) and INS rs2585 (P-value = 7 × 10–4), and maternally-transmitted KCNQ1(OT1) rs231841 (P-value = 1 × 10–3) and KCNQ1(OT1) rs7929804 (P-value = 4 × 10–3), were used to construct a composite fetal imprinted gene allele score which was associated with maternal glucose concentrations (P-value = 4.3 × 10–6, n = 981, r2 = 2.0%) and GDM prevalence (odds ratio per allele 1.44 (1.15, 1.80), P-value = 1 × 10–3, n = 89 cases and 899 controls). Meta-analysis of the associations including data from 1367 Hyperglycaemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome Study participants confirmed the paternally-transmitted fetal IGF2/INS SNP associations (rs10770125, P-value = 3.2 × 10–8, rs2585, P-value = 3.6 × 10–5) and the composite fetal imprinted gene allele score association (P-value = 1.3 × 10–8), but not the maternally-transmitted fetal KCNQ1(OT1) associations (rs231841, P-value = 0.4; rs7929804, P-value = 0.2). Conclusion This study suggests that polymorphic variation in fetal imprinted genes, particularly in the IGF2/INS region, contribute a small but significant part to the risk of raised late pregnancy maternal glucose concentrations.

  CSV Title: Prospects for dedicated energy crop production and attitudes towards agricultural straw use: The case of livestock farmers
  CSV Abstract: Second generation biofuels utilising agricultural by-products (e.g. straw), or dedicated energy crops (DECs) produced on'marginal' land, have been called for. A structured telephone survey of 263 livestock farmers, predominantly located in the west or 'marginal' upland areas of England captured data on attitudes towards straw use and DECs. Combined with farm physical and business data, the survey results show that 7.2% and 6.3% of farmers would respectively consider growing SRC and miscanthus, producing respective maximum potential English crop areas of 54,603 ha and 43,859 ha. If higher market prices for straw occurred, most livestock farmers would continue to buy straw. Reasons for not being willing to consider growing DECs include concerns over land quality, committing land for a long time period, lack of appropriate machinery, profitability, and time tofinancial return; a range of moral, land quality, production conflict and lack of crop knowledge factors were also cited. Results demonstrate limited potential for the production of DECs on livestock farms in England. Changes in policy support to address farmer concerns with respect to DECs will be required to incentivise farmers to increase energy crop production. Policy support for DEC production must be cognisant of farm-level economic, tenancy and personal objectives.

  CSV Title: International incidence of psychotic disorders, 2002–17: a systematic review and meta-analysis
  CSV Abstract:  Background: The last comprehensive systematic review of the incidence of psychotic disorders was published in 2004. New epidemiological data from different settings now permit a broader understanding of global variation. We examined the variation in psychosis by demographic characteristics and study method. Methods: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and bibliographies, and directly contacted first authors. We sought to obtain citations of original research published between Jan 1, 2002, and Dec 31, 2017, on incidence of non-organic adult-onset psychotic disorder. We included papers that were published or in grey literature and had no language restrictions. Data were extracted from published reports, where possible, by sex, age, and ethnic group. Quality of yield was assessed. Data were assessed using univariable random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression. We registered our systematic review on PROSPERO, number CRD42018086800. Findings: From 56 721 records identified, 177 met inclusion criteria. The pooled incidence of all psychotic disorders was 26·6 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 22·0–31·7). Heterogeneity was high (I 2 ≥98·5%). Men were at higher risk of all psychotic disorders (incidence rate ratio 1·44 [1·27–1·62]) and non-affective disorders (1·60 [1·44–1·77]) than women, but not affective psychotic disorders (0·87 [0·75–1·00]). Ethnic minorities were also at excess risk of all psychotic disorders (1·75 [1·53–2·00]), including non-affective disorders (1·71 [1·40–2·09]). Meta-regression revealed that population registers reported higher rates of non-affective disorders (9·64 [2·72–31·82]), schizophrenia (2·51 [1·24–5·21]), and bipolar disorder (4·53 [2·41–8·51]) than first contact study designs. Interpretation: We found marked variation in incidence of psychotic disorders by personal characteristics and place. Some geographical variation could be partially explained by differences in case ascertainment methods. Funding: None.

  CSV Title: Genomic Approaches Reveal an Endemic Subpopulation of Gray Wolves in Southern China
  CSV Abstract: Although gray wolves (Canis lupus) are one of the most widely distributed terrestrial mammals, their origins in China are not well understood. We sequenced six specimens from wolf skins, showing that gray wolves from Southern China (SC) derive from a single lineage, distinct from gray wolves from the Tibetan Plateau and Northern China, suggesting that SC gray wolves may form a distinct subpopulation. Of SC gray wolves, one wolf from Zhejiang carries a genetic component from a canid and had gene flow from a population related to or further diverged from wolves than the dhole. This may indicate that interspecific gene flow likely played an important role in shaping the speciation patterns and population structure in the genus Canis. Our study is the first to survey museum gray wolves' genomes from Southern China, highlighting how sequencing the paleogenome from museum specimens can help us to study extinct species.

  CSV Title: Tribological and microstructural investigation of hybrid AA8011/ZrB2-Si3N4 nanomaterials for service life improvement
  CSV Abstract: The effect of ZrB2-Si3N4 particle reinforcement on the tribological behavior and microstructure of AA8011 alloy has been studied. ZrB2-Si3N4 particles were varied from 0 wt% to 20 wt% with an interval of 5 wt%. Dry sliding pin-on-disc tests at a room temperature condition were conducted to investigate the wear performances of the aluminium alloy/ ZrB2-Si3N4 composites. The tests were conducted at varying loads, from 20 to 40 N. The results depicted that the wear rates of the AA8011 alloy/ZrB2-Si3N4 composites are lower than that of the AA8011 and further decreases with increasing ZrB2-Si3N4 content, Also, the friction coefficient of the matrix alloy is higher than that of the composites and decreases with increasing ZrB2-Si3N4 content. This established the unique efficacy of ZrB2-Si3N4 effect on performance characteristics of aluminium series in application.

  CSV Title: Mortality trends and differentials in South Africa from 1997 to 2012: second National Burden of Disease Study
  CSV Abstract: Background The poor health of South Africans is known to be associated with a quadruple disease burden. In the second National Burden of Disease (NBD) study, we aimed to analyse cause of death data for 1997–2012 and develop national, population group, and provincial estimates of the levels and causes of mortality. Method We used underlying cause of death data from death notifications for 1997–2012 obtained from Statistics South Africa. These data were adjusted for completeness using indirect demographic techniques for adults and comparison with survey and census estimates for child mortality. A regression approach was used to estimate misclassified HIV/AIDS deaths and so-called garbage codes were proportionally redistributed by age, sex, and population group population group (black African, Indian or Asian descent, white [European descent], and coloured [of mixed ancestry according to the preceding categories]). Injury deaths were estimated from additional data sources. Age-standardised death rates were calculated with mid-year population estimates and the WHO age standard. Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation Global Burden of Disease (IHME GBD) estimates for South Africa were obtained from the IHME GHDx website for comparison. Findings All-cause age-standardised death rates increased rapidly since 1997, peaked in 2006 and then declined, driven by changes in HIV/AIDS. Mortality from tuberculosis, non-communicable diseases, and injuries decreased slightly. In 2012, HIV/AIDS caused the most deaths (29·1%) followed by cerebrovascular disease (7·5%) and lower respiratory infections (4·9%). All-cause age-standardised death rates were 1·7 times higher in the province with the highest death rate compared to the province with the lowest death rate, 2·2 times higher in black Africans compared to whites, and 1·4 times higher in males compared with females. Comparison with the IHME GBD estimates for South Africa revealed substantial differences for estimated deaths from all causes, particularly HIV/AIDS and interpersonal violence. Interpretation This study shows the reversal of HIV/AIDS, non-communicable disease, and injury mortality trends in South Africa during the study period. Mortality differentials show the importance of social determinants, raise concerns about the quality of health services, and provide relevant information to policy makers for addressing inequalities. Differences between GBD estimates for South Africa and this study emphasise the need for more careful calibration of global models with local data.

  CSV Title: Sensory profile of rooibos originating from the Western and Northern Cape governed by production year and development of rooibos aroma wheel
  CSV Abstract: Aspalathus linearis is cultivated in the Western Cape and Northern Cape provinces of South Africa for the production of rooibos, a herbal tea with a global footprint. A total of 208 samples, spanning the two production areas, three production years and three quality grades, were collected to delineate the effect of production area and year on rooibos sensory properties, as well as to ensure large variation, required for revision of the rooibos sensory wheel. The samples were analysed using descriptive sensory analysis to provide comprehensive profiling of aroma, flavour, taste and mouthfeel attributes. The primary aroma characteristic profile of rooibos, previously described as “rooibos-woody”, “fynbos-floral” and “honey” was confirmed. Other aroma attributes that were perceived frequently and at high intensity in the sample set were “fruity-sweet”, “caramel” and “apricot”. Although not occurring as commonly as those of the primary aroma profile of rooibos, these attributes, manifested in samples from both production areas, forming a secondary aroma profile. In the present study the “hay/dried grass” aroma note appeared in 99% of the rooibos samples at low intensities and could therefore be considered to be part of the “characteristic” aroma profile of rooibos. No clear differences between production areas were evident, but production years could be distinguished based on differences in perceived aroma attribute intensities. The aroma wheel is more user-friendly as it will provide users, at a glance, with the relative importance of attributes (as determined by intensity and occurrence frequency). This is achieved by varying slice width according to the relative mean attribute intensity and the use of accompanying bar graphs indicating relative occurrence frequency of attributes. This quality control and “communication” tool can be used by industry to aid in the grading and marketing of rooibos tea.

  CSV Title: Curing conditions to inactivate Trichinella spiralis muscle larvae in ready-to-eat pork sausage
  CSV Abstract: Curing processes are one method by which pork products, which are considered ready to eat (RTE) and have not been otherwise tested or treated, can be rendered safe from risk for exposure to Trichinella muscle larvae (ML). Curing processes in the U.S. currently require individual validation of methods to demonstrate inactivation of Trichinella. This is a major undertaking for each process; currently no model of meat chemistry exists that can be correlated with inactivation of Trichinella. Given the potential for new RTE products (e.g., lower salt), the availability of a wider range of tested methods for inactivation of Trichinella in pork would be of substantial value to the industry. In this study, five variables were tested – salt/brine concentration, water activity (aw), pH, temperature, and time, using low and high endpoints for common curing treatments for dry cured pork sausage. The data demonstrated that NaCl concentrations above 1.3%, in combination with fermentation to pH 5.2 or below, resulted in inactivation of > 96% of Trichinella ML in stuffed sausages within 24–28 h.

  CSV Title: Death as the border: Managing missing migrants and unidentified bodies at the EU's Mediterranean frontier
  CSV Abstract: The paper explores how the management of migrant bodies by national and EU authorities reflects particular understandings of contemporary borders and how the failure to address such bodies has implications far from the frontier. The study of the management both of the dead and of the data that can serve to identify missing migrants, can benefit our understanding of the contemporary border, and has to date received only limited scholarly attention. To address this gap we draw on field research carried out on the Greek island of Lesbos, one of the key migrant entry points to the EU, that has seen repeated incidents of deadly shipwrecks. Based on interviews with families of migrants and local stakeholders the paper explores how death at the border introduces novel – and often invisible – borders and categories of inclusion and exclusion. By shedding light on the experiences of the families of the dead we aspire to introduce a critical set of actors who have been marginalized from the study of the border. In exploring the remote effects of deaths on such families in migrant countries of origin, the paper shows that bordering practices have transnational impacts at the human level, thereby broadening our conceptualization of the border.

  CSV Title: Resistance and tolerance to the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Stål), in rice infested at different growth stages across a gradient of nitrogen applications
  CSV Abstract: High resource availability can reduce anti-herbivore resistance (a plant's ability to defend against herbivores and reduce damage) in rice, Oryza sativa L, but may also increase tolerance (a plant's ability to withstand damage by, for example, compensatory growth). Through a series of greenhouse, screenhouse and field experiments, this study examines fitness (survival and development × reproduction) of the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Stål), on resistant (IR62) and susceptible (IR22) rice varieties and age-related rice tolerance to planthopper damage under varying resource (nitrogenous fertilizer) availability. Planthoppers reared on IR62 in the greenhouse had lower fitness than planthoppers on IR22. IR62 became increasingly resistant as plants aged. IR22 was generally more tolerant of planthopper damage, and tolerance increased in IR22, but declined in IR62, as the plants aged. Rice plants infested at pre-tillering stages (3–4 leaf stage) in the screenhouse had greater losses to root, shoot and grain yield per unit weight of planthopper than plants infested at tillering stages, particularly in IR22. These trends were mainly due to the impact of planthoppers during pre-tillering stages and the length of exposure to the planthoppers. High nitrogen compromised IR62 resistance, particularly in tillering plants in the greenhouse study; however, high nitrogen did not increase planthopper biomass-density on IR62 in greenhouse or field cages. Tolerance to damage in IR62 at mid-tillering stages declined under increasing levels of nitrogen, but nitrogen increased tolerance during late-tillering stages. Planthopper damage to IR22 in field cages was severe and hopperburn (plant death) occurred in 83% of IR22 plants under high nitrogen (60–150 kg N ha−1). In contrast, despite planthopper infestations, damage to IR62 was low in field-grown plants and productivity (tillers, roots, shoots and grain) increased in IR62 under increasing nitrogen. Our results indicate that, whereas nitrogenous fertilizer increases planthopper fitness on susceptible and resistant varieties, the net effects of high nitrogen on IR62 include decreased planthopper biomass-density (apparent in all experiments) and higher tolerance to damage during later growth stages (observed in the greenhouse, and during one of two seasons in field cages).

  CSV Title: Wear performance and characterisation of coatings for nuclear applications: WC-(W,Cr)2C-Ni and hard chromium plate
  CSV Abstract: The nuclear industry has used hard chromium plate for many years but is seeking alternatives, due to the adverse health effects of Cr(VI) employed in electroplating. In this study, testing and analysis regimes for the comparison of the sliding wear performance of candidate materials have been established and the performance of WC-(W,Cr)2C-Ni has been compared with that of hard chromium plate. WC-(W,Cr)2C-Ni was applied to Inconel 625 substrates using a detonation gun thermal spray technique. Sliding wear testing was performed using a ball-on-flat configuration reciprocating tribometer at 20 °C in three environments: dry, deionised water and simulated nuclear reactor water chemistry. Wear rates have been evaluated, using both mass and volume loss, and the worn samples were analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The WC-(W,Cr)2C-Ni coating had a broadly comparable wear performance to hard chromium plate in all three environments. There were differences between deionised and borated water, such that the latter needs to be used in further evaluation. SEM and XPS analyses enabled the wear mechanisms for WC-(W,Cr)2C-Ni and HCP to be elucidated, including pull-out and tribolayer formation. XPS has shown that the tribolayer on WC-(W,Cr)2C-Ni is stratified and undergoes chemical changes as a result of wear.

  CSV Title: Filopodome Mapping Identifies p130Cas as a Mechanosensitive Regulator of Filopodia Stability
  CSV Abstract: Filopodia are adhesive cellular protrusions specialized in the detection of extracellular matrix (ECM)-derived cues. Although ECM engagement at focal adhesions is known to trigger the recruitment of hundreds of proteins (“adhesome”) to fine-tune cellular behavior, the components of the filopodia adhesions remain undefined. Here, we performed a structured-illumination-microscopy-based screen to map the localization of 80 target proteins, linked to cell adhesion and migration, within myosin-X-induced filopodia. We demonstrate preferential enrichment of several adhesion proteins to either filopodia tips, filopodia shafts, or shaft subdomains, suggesting divergent, spatially restricted functions for these proteins. Moreover, proteins with phosphoinositide (PI) binding sites are particularly enriched in filopodia. This, together with the strong localization of PI(3,4)P2 in filopodia tips, predicts critical roles for PIs in regulating filopodia ultra-structure and function. Our mapping further reveals that filopodia adhesions consist of a unique set of proteins, the filopodome, that are distinct from classical nascent adhesions, focal adhesions, and fibrillar adhesions. Using live imaging, we observe that filopodia adhesions can give rise to nascent adhesions, which, in turn, form focal adhesions. We demonstrate that p130Cas (BCAR1) is recruited to filopodia tips via its C-terminal Cas family homology domain (CCHD) and acts as a mechanosensitive regulator of filopodia stability. Finally, we demonstrate that our map based on myosin-X-induced filopodia can be translated to endogenous filopodia and fascin- and IRSp53-mediated filopodia.

  CSV Title: Effect of inactivated Streptococcus pneumoniae as non-pathogenic particles on the severity of pneumonia caused by respiratory syncytial virus infection in mice
  CSV Abstract: The severity of pneumonia in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is strongly related to host immune response and external factors such as bacteria and environmental chemicals. We investigated the effect of inactivated Streptococcus pneumoniae (ISP) as non-pathogenic particles on the severity of pneumonia in RSV-infected mice. Mice were intranasally exposed to ISP before RSV infection. On day 5 post-infection, we examined tissues, virus titer, and infiltrated cells in the lungs. The ISP did not cause significant histopathological effects in the lungs of RSV infected mice, but reduced virus titer. It also reduced the ratio of lymphocyte infiltration into the lungs and consequently the ratio of macrophage increased. In addition, we found that ISP increased RANTES level in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from RSV-infected mice on day 1 post-infection, but reduced type I interferon levels. Thus, ISP did not exacerbate pneumonia in RSV infection, rather, it might mildly reduce the severity. We characterize and discuss the inherent activity of ISP as non-pathogenic particles inducing the role of RANTES on the pneumonia in RSV infection.

  CSV Title: Immunogenicity, transplacental transfer of pertussis antibodies and safety following pertussis immunization during pregnancy: Evidence from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial
  CSV Abstract: Background: Pertussis immunization during pregnancy is recommended in many countries. Data from large randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of this approach. Methods: This phase IV, observer-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial assessed immunogenicity, transplacental transfer of maternal pertussis antibodies, reactogenicity and safety of a reduced-antigen-content diphtheria-tetanus-three-component acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) during pregnancy. Women received Tdap or placebo at 27–36 weeks’ gestation with crossover ≤ 72-hour-postpartum immunization. Immune responses were assessed before the pregnancy dose and 1 month after, and from the umbilical cord at delivery. Superiority (primary objective) was reached if the lower limits of the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the pertussis geometric mean concentration (GMC) ratios (Tdap/control) in cord blood were ≥ 1.5. Solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) and pregnancy-/neonate-related AEs of interest were recorded. Results: 687 pregnant women were vaccinated (Tdap: N = 341 control: N = 346). Superiority of the pertussis immune response (maternally transferred pertussis antibodies in cord blood) was demonstrated by the GMC ratios (Tdap/control): 16.1 (95% CI: 13.5–19.2) for anti-filamentous hemagglutinin, 20.7 (15.9–26.9) for anti-pertactin and 8.5 (7.0–10.2) for anti-pertussis toxoid. Rates of pregnancy-/neonate-related AEs of interest, solicited general and unsolicited AEs were similar between groups. None of the serious AEs reported throughout the study were considered related to maternal Tdap vaccination. Conclusions: Tdap vaccination during pregnancy resulted in high levels of pertussis antibodies in cord blood, was well tolerated and had an acceptable safety profile. This supports the recommendation of Tdap vaccination during pregnancy to prevent early-infant pertussis disease. Clinical Trial Registration. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02377349.

  CSV Title: Genetic variants associated with susceptibility to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in people of European ancestry: a genome-wide association study
  CSV Abstract: Background Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive lung disease with high mortality, uncertain cause, and few treatment options. Studies have identified a significant genetic risk associated with the development of IPF; however, mechanisms by which genetic risk factors promote IPF remain unclear. We aimed to identify genetic variants associated with IPF susceptibility and provide mechanistic insight using gene and protein expression analyses. Methods We used a two-stage approach: a genome-wide association study in patients with IPF of European ancestry recruited from nine different centres in the UK and controls selected from UK Biobank (stage 1) matched for age, sex, and smoking status; and a follow-up of associated genetic variants in independent datasets of patients with IPF and controls from two independent US samples from the Chicago consortium and the Colorado consortium (stage 2). We investigated the effect of novel signals on gene expression in large transcriptomic and genomic data resources, and examined expression using lung tissue samples from patients with IPF and controls. Findings 602 patients with IPF and 3366 controls were selected for stage 1. For stage 2, 2158 patients with IPF and 5195 controls were selected. We identified a novel genome-wide significant signal of association with IPF susceptibility near A-kinase anchoring protein 13 (AKAP13; rs62025270, odds ratio [OR] 1·27 [95% CI 1·18–1·37], p=1·32 × 10−9) and confirmed previously reported signals, including in mucin 5B (MUC5B; rs35705950, OR 2·89 [2·56–3·26], p=1·12 × 10−66) and desmoplakin (DSP; rs2076295, OR 1·44 [1·35–1·54], p=7·81 × 10−28). For rs62025270, the allele A associated with increased susceptibility to IPF was also associated with increased expression of AKAP13 mRNA in lung tissue from patients who had lung resection procedures (n=1111). We showed that AKAP13 is expressed in the alveolar epithelium and lymphoid follicles from patients with IPF, and AKAP13 mRNA expression was 1·42-times higher in lung tissue from patients with IPF (n=46) than that in lung tissue from controls (n=51). Interpretation AKAP13 is a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor regulating activation of RhoA, which is known to be involved in profibrotic signalling pathways. The identification of AKAP13 as a susceptibility gene for IPF increases the prospect of successfully targeting RhoA pathway inhibitors in patients with IPF.

  CSV Title: Improving nutrition through biofortification: A review of evidence from HarvestPlus, 2003 through 2016
  CSV Abstract: Biofortification is a feasible and cost-effective means of delivering micronutrients to populations that may have limited access to diverse diets and other micronutrient interventions. Since 2003, HarvestPlus and its partners have demonstrated that this agriculture-based method of addressing micronutrient deficiency through plant breeding works. More than 20 million people in farm households in developing countries are now growing and consuming biofortified crops. This review summarizes key evidence and discusses delivery experiences, as well as farmer and consumer adoption. Given the strength of the evidence, attention should now shift to an action-oriented agenda for scaling biofortification to improve nutrition globally. To reach one billion people by 2030, there are three key challenges: 1) mainstreaming biofortified traits into public plant breeding programs; 2) building consumer demand; and 3) integrating biofortification into public and private policies, programs, and investments. While many building blocks are in place, institutional leadership is needed to continue to drive towards this ambitious goal.

  CSV Title: Trivalent chromium conversion coating formation on aluminium
  CSV Abstract: The formation of a trivalent conversion coating on aluminium has been investigated using analytical electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, ion beam analysis, glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The coating is shown to comprise a chromium- and zirconium-rich outer layer and an aluminium-rich inner layer. Zirconium and chromium are present in chemical states consistent with ZrO2, ZrF4, Cr(OH)3, Cr2(SO4)3, CrF3 and CrO3 or CrO42-. However, negligible amounts of Cr(VI) species occurred in coatings formed in de-aerated solution. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that the inner layer provides the main corrosion protection during short-term tests in 0.1M sodium sulphate solution at room temperature.

  CSV Title: Prediction of Streptococcus uberis clinical mastitis risk using Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) in dairy herds
  CSV Abstract: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the risk of Streptococcus uberis clinical mastitis at cow level could be predicted from the historical presence of specific strains of S. uberis on dairy farms. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry was used to identify S. uberis isolates potentially capable of contagious transmission. Data were available from 10,652 cows from 52 English and Welsh dairy farms over a 14 month period, and 521 isolates of S. uberis from clinical mastitis cases were available for analysis. As well as the temporal herd history of clinical mastitis associated with particular S. uberis strains, other exposure variables included cow parity, stage of lactation, milk yield, and somatic cell count. Observations were structured longitudinally as repeated weekly measures through the study period for each cow. Data were analyzed in a Bayesian framework using multilevel logistic regression models. Similarity of mass spectral profiles between isolates of S. uberis from consecutive clinical cases of mastitis in herds was used to indicate potential for contagious phenotypic characteristics. Cross validation showed that new isolates with these characteristics could be identified with an accuracy of 90% based on bacterial protein mass spectral characteristics alone. The cow-level risk in any week of these S. uberis clinical mastitis cases increased with the presence of the same specific strains of S. uberis in other cows in the herd during the previous 2 weeks. The final statistical model indicated there would be a 2–3 fold increase in the risk of S. uberis clinical mastitis associated with particular strains if these occurred in the herd 1 and 2 weeks previously. The results suggest that specific strains of S. uberis may be involved with contagious transmission, and predictions based on their occurrence could be used as an early warning surveillance system to enhance the control of S. uberis mastitis.

  CSV Title: A comparison of azimuthal and axial oscillation microfiltration using surface and matrix types of microfilters with a cake-slurry shear plane exhibiting non-Newtonian behaviour
  CSV Abstract: The mode of application of oscillation, axial or azimuthal, did not influence filtration performance, when filtering a calcite mineral with a d32 value of 2.7 µm. The equilibrium flux and deposit thickness correlated with shear stress, regardless of: filter type (metal slotted surface filter or homogeneous sintered filter); and mode of oscillation. Shear stress values up to 240 Pa were used and the particle compact believed to be at, or near, the deposited solids showed non-Newtonian flow behaviour described by the Herschel-Bulkley equation. The shear was computed using Comsol® to model the shear at, and near, the oscillating surface. The peak shear (maximum value) was used in the correlation for flux, which appeared to fit the data well and provide a realistic prediction for sustainable flux using a force balance model. The existence of a yield stress in the compact appeared to limit the internal fouling of the matrix (homogeneous) type of filter, which had a membrane thickness of 8 mm, but did not demonstrate significant internal fouling over time, nor between filtrations. Thus, the results were similar to those obtained for the surface filters, and the resistance to filtration was dominated by the deposit formed.

  CSV Title: Theoretical investigation of the phase stability and elastic properties of TiZrHfNb-based high entropy alloys
  CSV Abstract: First principles calculations are performed to study the effects of alloying elements (X = Al, Si, Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Cu, Zn, Y, Mo, Ta, W and Re) on the phase stability and elastic properties of TiZrHfNb refractory high entropy alloys. Both equimolar and non-equimolar alloys are considered. It is shown that the calculated lattice parameters, phase stability and elastic moduli of equimolar TiZrHfNbX are consistent with the available experimental and theoretical results. The substitutions of alloying elements at Ti, Zr, and Hf sites with various contents show similar effects on the phase stability and elastic properties of the TiZrHfNb-based alloys. The substitutions on Nb site are found to generally decrease the stability of body centered cubic phase. Close connections between the charge densities at the Wigner-Seitz cell boundary and the bulk moduli of TiZrHfNb-based alloys are found. The present results provide a quantitative model for exploring the phase stability and elastic properties of TiZrHfNb-based alloys from the electronic structure viewpoint.

  CSV Title: HDAC2 expression in parvalbumin interneurons regulates synaptic plasticity in the mouse visual cortex
  CSV Abstract: An experience-dependent postnatal increase in GABAergic inhibition in the visual cortex is important for the closure of a critical period of enhanced synaptic plasticity. Although maturation of the subclass of parvalbumin (Pv)-expressing GABAergic interneurons is known to contribute to critical period closure, the role of epigenetics on cortical inhibition and synaptic plasticity has not been explored. The transcription regulator, histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), has been shown to modulate synaptic plasticity and learning processes in hippocampal excitatory neurons. We found that genetic deletion of HDAC2 specifically from Pv interneurons reduces inhibitory input in the visual cortex of adult mice and coincides with enhanced long-term depression that is more typical of young mice. These findings show that HDAC2 loss in Pv interneurons leads to a delayed closure of the critical period in the visual cortex and supports the hypothesis that HDAC2 is a key negative regulator of synaptic plasticity in the adult brain.

  CSV Title: Osteoprotegerin autoantibodies do not predict low bone mineral density in middle-aged women
  CSV Abstract: Purpose Autoantibodies against osteoprotegerin (OPG) have been associated with osteoporosis. The aim was to develop an immunoassay for OPG autoantibodies and test their diagnostic usefulness of identifying women general population with low bone mineral density. Methods Included were 698 women at mean age 55.1 years (range 50.4–60.6) randomly selected from the general population. Measurement of wrist bone mineral density (g/cm2) was performed of the non-dominant wrist by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). A T-score < − 2.5 was defined as having a low bone mineral density. Measurements of OPG autoantibodies were carried by radiobinding assays. Cut-off levels for a positive value were determined from the deviation from normality in the distribution of 398 healthy blood donors representing the 99.7th percentile. Results Forty-five of the 698 (6.6%) women were IgG-OPG positive compared with 2 of 398 (0.5%) controls (p < 0.0001) and 35 of the 698 (5.0%) women had a T-score < − 2.5. There was no difference in bone mineral density between IgG-OPG positive (median 0.439 (range 0.315–0.547) g/cm2) women and IgG-OPG negative (median 0.435 (range 0.176–0.652) g/cm2) women (p = 0.3956). Furthermore, there was neither a correlation between IgG-OPG levels and bone mineral density (rs = 0.1896; p = 0.2068) nor T-score (rs = 0.1889; p = 0.2086). Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of IgG-OPG for low bone mineral density were 5.7% and 92.9%, and positive and negative predictive values were 7.4% and 90.8%, respectively. Conclusion Elevated OPG autoantibody levels do not predict low bone mineral density in middle-aged women selected from the general population.

  CSV Title: Graphitic Carbon Nitride as a Catalyst Support in Fuel Cells and Electrolyzers
  CSV Abstract: Electrochemical power sources, such as polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), require the use of precious metal catalysts which are deposited as nanoparticles onto supports in order to minimize their mass loading and therefore cost. State-of-the-art/commercial supports are based on forms of carbon black. However, carbon supports present disadvantages including corrosion in the operating fuel cell environment and loss of catalyst activity. Here we review recent work examining the potential of different varieties of graphitic carbon nitride (gCN) as catalyst supports, highlighting their likely benefits, as well as the challenges associated with their implementation. The performance of gCN and hybrid gCN-carbon materials as PEMFC electrodes is discussed, as well as their potential for use in alkaline systems and water electrolyzers. We illustrate the discussion with examples taken from our own recent studies.

  CSV Title: Microstructural characterisation of Tristelle 5183 (Fe-21%Cr-10%Ni-7.5%Nb-5%Si-2%C in wt%) alloy powder produced by gas atomisation
  CSV Abstract: Nitrogen gas atomised powders of the hardfacing alloy Tristelle 5183 (Fe-21%Cr-10%Ni-7%Nb-5%Si-2%C in wt%) were sieved into different particle size ranges and their microstructures have been investigated. Powder particles larger than approximately 53 μm are composed of dendritic fcc γ-Fe as the principal phase with smaller quantities of: α-Fe, an interdendritic silicide phase isostructural to Fe5Ni3Si2, and Nb(C,N). Particles <53 μm have increasing quantities of either dendritic α-Fe or cellular silicide phase with decreasing amounts of γ-Fe as the particle size decreases, along with ~5% Nb(C,N). Coarse (> 10 μm) sized Nb(C,N) particles, that are seen in all powder size fractions, pre-existed in the melt prior to atomisation, whereas micron-sized Nb(C,N) particles that are found within α-Fe, γ-Fe or silicide are the primary solidification phase. Nanoscale Nb(C,N) also formed interdendritically in the last stages of solidification. Compared with a mould cast sample, a significant difference is the suppression of M7C3 formation in all powder size ranges. The increasing quantities of α-Fe and silicide in smaller sized powder particles is consistent with increased undercooling prior to nucleation permitting metastable phase formation.

  CSV Title: Development of a reference material for Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin A in cheese: Feasibility study, processing, homogeneity and stability assessment
  CSV Abstract: Staphylococcal food poisoning is caused by enterotoxins excreted into foods by strains of staphylococci. Commission Regulation 1441/2007 specifies thresholds for the presence of these toxins in foods. In this article we report on the progress towards reference materials (RMs) for Staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) in cheese. RMs are crucial to enforce legislation and to implement and safeguard reliable measurements. First, a feasibility study revealed a suitable processing procedure for cheese powders: the blank material was prepared by cutting, grinding, freeze-drying and milling. For the spiked material, a cheese-water slurry was spiked with SEA solution, freeze-dried and diluted with blank material to the desired SEA concentration. Thereafter, batches of three materials (blank; two SEA concentrations) were processed. The materials were shown to be sufficiently homogeneous, and storage at ambient temperature for 4 weeks did not indicate degradation. These results provide the basis for the development of a RM for SEA in cheese. © 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

  CSV Title: Effect of pretreatments prior to drying on antioxidant properties of dried mango slices
  CSV Abstract: Chemical, thermal or osmotic pretreatments prior to drying can improve the quality aspects of dried foods. Three pretreatments prior to drying were evaluated for antioxidant capacity in two mango varieties viz. Ngowe and apple that were dehydrated in either, oven (50 and 65 °C) and solar dryer. The antioxidant properties analyzed included polyphenols, vitamin C, carotenoids, flavonoids and total antioxidant activity. Total polyphenol content was determined through Folin–Ciocalteu method and quantified using UV-Spectrophotometer. Vitamin C was analyzed by HPLC system while total carotenoids, total antioxidants, and flavonoids were analyzed using UV-Spectrophotometer at varied wavelengths. Method of drying and pretreatment type had significant effect (p ≤ 0.01) on the flavonoid content, total carotenoids and β-carotene for differently pretreated and dried mango slices. The results showed increased content in total antioxidants, polyphenols and flavonoids for the pretreated and dried slices compared to the fresh samples of both varieties. The highest flavonoid content (43.66 ± 1.27 mg/100 g) was recorded in 1% citric acid pretreated samples dried at 50 °C while the lowest amount (16.73 ± 1.14 mg/100 g) was recorded in blanched Ngowe oven dried at 65 °C. Vitamin C decreased with increased drying temperature from 50–65 °C and the largest value (78.87 ± 0.46 mg/100 g) was observed in fresh Apple mango variety while the lowest value (28.45 mg/100 g) was observed in Ngowe variety samples oven dried at 65 °C for 10 h. β-carotene for dried mango slices ranged from 6.65 mg/100 g to 40.88 mg/100 g among the differently pretreated and dried mango slices and the values were lower than the content in fresh samples in the respective varieties. Total polyphenol content varied from 5.83–29.9 mg (GAE)/100 g. This research demonstrated that appropriate pretreatments in this case, 1% citric acid pretreatment prior to drying at 50 °C can enhance retention of antioxidants in dried mango product.

  CSV Title: Population-based resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates to pyrazinamide and fluoroquinolones: results from a multicountry surveillance project
  CSV Abstract: Background Pyrazinamide and fluoroquinolones are essential antituberculosis drugs in new rifampicin-sparing regimens. However, little information about the extent of resistance to these drugs at the population level is available. Methods In a molecular epidemiology analysis, we used population-based surveys from Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Pakistan, and South Africa to investigate resistance to pyrazinamide and fluoroquinolones among patients with tuberculosis. Resistance to pyrazinamide was assessed by gene sequencing with the detection of resistance-conferring mutations in the pncA gene, and susceptibility testing to fluoroquinolones was conducted using the MGIT system. Findings Pyrazinamide resistance was assessed in 4972 patients. Levels of resistance varied substantially in the surveyed settings (3·0–42·1%). In all settings, pyrazinamide resistance was significantly associated with rifampicin resistance. Among 5015 patients who underwent susceptibility testing to fluoroquinolones, proportions of resistance ranged from 1·0–16·6% for ofloxacin, to 0·5–12·4% for levofloxacin, and 0·9–14·6% for moxifloxacin when tested at 0·5 μg/mL. High levels of ofloxacin resistance were detected in Pakistan. Resistance to moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin when tested at 2 μg/mL was low in all countries. Interpretation Although pyrazinamide resistance was significantly associated with rifampicin resistance, this drug may still be effective in 19–63% of patients with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis. Even though the high level of resistance to ofloxacin found in Pakistan is worrisome because it might be the expression of extensive and unregulated use of fluoroquinolones in some parts of Asia, the negligible levels of resistance to fourth-generation fluoroquinolones documented in all survey sites is an encouraging finding. Rational use of this class of antibiotics should therefore be ensured to preserve its effectiveness.

  CSV Title: Differences in IgG responses against infection phase related Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) specific antigens in individuals exposed or not to Mtb correlate with control of TB infection and progression
  CSV Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) occurs in only 3–10% of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infected individuals, suggesting that natural immunity can contain Mtb infection, although this remains poorly understood. Next to T-cells, a potentially protective role for B-cells and antibodies has emerged recently. However, the Mtb antigens involved remain ill-defined. Here, we investigated in a TB-endemic setting IgG levels against 15 Mtb antigens, representing various phases of Mtb infection and known to be potent human T-cell antigens. IgG levels against ESAT6/CFP10, Rv0440, Rv0867c, Rv1737c, Rv2029c, Rv2215, Rv2389c, Rv3616c and Mtb purified protein derivative (PPD) were higher in TB patients than in endemic and non-endemic controls. The only exception was Rv1733c that was preferentially recognized by antibodies from endemic controls compared to TB patients and non-endemic controls, suggesting a potential correlation with control of TB infection and progression. In patients, IgG levels against Ag85B and Rv2029c correlated with Mtb loads, while immunoglobulins against Rv0440 differed between genders. Our results support the potential role of certain Mtb antigen-(Rv1733c) specific antibodies in the control of TB infection and progression, while other Mtb antigen-specific antibodies correlate with TB disease activity and bacillary loads. The findings for Rv1733c agree with previous T-cell results and have implications for including antibody-mediated immunity in designing new strategies to control TB.

  CSV Title: Determinants of urinary concentrations of dialkyl phosphates among pregnant women in Canada - Results from the MIREC study
  CSV Abstract: Organophosphate (OP) insecticides are commonly used in agriculture. Their use decreased in recent years as they were gradually replaced by other pesticides, but some OPs are still among the insecticides most used in Canada. Exposure to elevated levels of OPs during pregnancy has been associated with adverse birth outcomes and poorer neurodevelopment in children. The objective of the present study was to examine the relationship between the concentrations of OP pesticides urinary dialkyl phosphate (DAP) metabolites and various factors that are potential sources of exposure or determinants of DAP levels. In the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) Study, six DAPs were measured in 1st trimester urine samples of 1884 pregnant women living in Canada. They were grouped into sums of dimethyl alkyl phosphates (DMAP) and diethyl alkyl phosphates (DEAP) for statistical analysis. We found that 93% of women had at least one DAP detected in their urine. Geometric means (GM) of specific gravity-corrected levels for urine dilution were 59 (95% CI 56-62) and 21 (95% CI 20-22) nmol/L for DMAP and DEAP, respectively. The following characteristics were significantly associated with higher urinary concentrations of DMAP or DEAP: higher education, nulliparous, normal pre-pregnancy body mass index, non-smoker, not fasting at sampling, winter season at sampling, and early and late day collection times. Dietary items that were significantly related with higher urinary concentrations included higher intake of citrus fruits, apple juice, sweet peppers, tomatoes, beans and dry peas, soy and rice beverages, whole grain bread, white wine and green and herbal teas. This study indicates that exposure to these compounds is quasi-ubiquitous. The factors associated with greater DAP levels identified here could be useful to regulatory agencies for risk analysis and management. However, some exposure misclassification might occur due to the single DAP measurement available, and to the presence of preformed DAPs in the environment.

  CSV Title: Data on the expression of cellular lncRNAs in human adenovirus infected cells
  CSV Abstract: Expression of cellular long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in human primary lung fibroblasts (IMR-90) during the course of adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) infection was studied by strand-specific whole transcriptome sequencing. In total, 645 cellular lncRNAs were expressed at a significant level and 398 of them were changed more than 2-fold. The changes in expression followed a distinct temporal pattern. Significantly, 80% of the changes occurred at the late phase and 80% of the de-regulated lncRNAs were up-regulated. The three largest groups of deregulated lncRNAs were 125 antisense RNAs, 111 pseudogenes and 85 long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs). Lastly, more than 36% of lncRNAs have been shown to interact with RNA binding proteins.

  CSV Title: An experimental study of the flow structure and acoustics of jets: Implications for volcano infrasound
  CSV Abstract: Aeroacoustic jet noise theory describes the relationship between acoustic signals and jet operating parameters. Based on empirical aeroacoustic relationships, a link between peak frequency and amplitude and jet diameter and velocity has been used by volcano acousticians to return the operating parameters of column generating volcanic eruptions. There are however significant differences between the nozzle geometries and structures of flows studied in the aeroacoustic literature and flows emitted from volcanic vents. These differences raise questions as to the validity of applying engineering relationships to volcanic eruptions. Combining particle image velocimetry and acoustic data we investigated the flow structures, acoustic signals and dominant source locations of jet flows emitted from three simple nozzle geometries (convergent, straight and divergent). Flows from the straight and divergent nozzles exited in a more developed flow regime than those emitted from convergent nozzles. While for the convergent nozzles dominant sound sources were located within the jet flow, the dominant signals from the straight and divergent nozzles were located in the region of the nozzle exit. Consequently, for the straight and divergent nozzles it was not possible to differentiate between signals generated by the jet flow and those generated by internal sound sources without beamforming analysis. In order to better replicate the volcanic case and in contrast to studies for industrial applications, our experimental test section was not engineered to minimise internal noise. Without acoustic treatment such as screens, choke plates and paddles, jet noise signals were contaminated by signals generated within the test rig and so, even for the convergent nozzles, the aeroacoustic relationships derived from engineering studies could not be used to retrieve the jet operating parameters. Our results indicate that in the volcanic case, the raw acoustic spectra will contain signals generated by both in-conduit and above-vent processes. Therefore inversions for volcanic jet parameters such as mass eruption rate from standard aeroacoustic relationships may be unreliable.

  CSV Title: Giant symptomatic serous cystadenoma mimicking carcinoma: A case report and literature review
  CSV Abstract: Introduction: Advanced imaging has led to an increase in the incidental diagnosis of pancreatic cysts. Serous cystadenomas (SCAs) account for nearly 30% of cases. These are typically considered benign lesions but up to 16% of cases are resected for aggressive behavior and symptoms. Presentation of case: A 64 year old female presented with a large incidental cyst in the pancreatic body. Pre-operative imaging conferred a diagnosis of SCA. After 2 years the cyst grew resulting in abdominal pain. Enlargement was associated with splenic vein occlusion and varices of the short gastric vessels. This change in behavior was concerning for malignant transformation. The cyst was resected by distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. The patient recovered with minimal morbidity. Final pathology revealed a 15.5 × 10.3 × 8.5 cm SCA with negative margins. Discussion: In this case a patient presents with aggressive radiographic features and new symptoms suggesting malignant transformation of a previously diagnosed SCA on imaging. Although malignant variants can be diagnosed by findings of metastatic deposits at the time of surgery or as recurrence years later, histologic findings cannot discriminate benign from malignant potential. Preoperative imaging is challenging with erroneous characterization in nearly 60% of cases. Conclusion: Based on the low risk of malignancy, selective surgical resection for SCA appears warranted. Accepted indications for surgery include development of symptoms or concern for correct diagnosis in a medically fit individual. Routine resection for cysts >4 cm has been suggested however, prospective studies are needed to determine benefit over risk rationale.

  CSV Abstract: This paper contributes to understanding national variations in using low-carbon electricity sources by comparing the evolution of nuclear, wind and solar power in Germany and Japan. It develops and applies a framework for analyzing low-carbon electricity transitions based on interplay of techno-economic, political and socio-technical processes. We explain why in the 1970s–1980s, the energy paths of the two countries were remarkably similar, but since the 1990s Germany has become a leader in renewables while phasing out nuclear energy, whereas Japan has deployed less renewables while becoming a leader in nuclear power. We link these differences to the faster growth of electricity demand and energy insecurity in Japan, the easier diffusion of onshore wind power technology and the weakening of the nuclear power regime induced by stagnation and competition from coal and renewables in Germany. We show how these changes involve the interplay of five distinct mechanisms which may also play a role in other energy transitions.

  CSV Title: Economic Decisions through Circuit Inhibition
  CSV Abstract: Ballesta and Padoa-Schioppa show that similar groups of neurons in the primate orbitofrontal cortex engage in choices between goods offered simultaneously or in sequence. Their results suggest that economic decisions rely on mechanisms of circuit inhibition whereby each offer value indirectly inhibits cells encoding the opposite choice outcome.

  CSV Title: Small molecule probes of protein aggregation
  CSV Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms of amyloid formation and toxicity remain major challenges. Although substantial progress has been made in the development of methods able to identify the species formed during self-assembly and to describe the kinetic mechanisms of aggregation, the structure(s) of non-native species, including potentially toxic oligomers, remain elusive. Moreover, how fibrils contribute to disease remains unclear. Here we review recent advances in the development of small molecules and other reagents that are helping to define the mechanisms of protein aggregation in molecular detail. Such probes form a powerful platform with which to better define the mechanisms of structural conversion into amyloid fibrils and may provide the much-needed stepping stone for future development of successful therapeutic agents.

  CSV Title: Using experimental de-worming to measure the immunological and pathological impacts of lungworm infection in cane toads
  CSV Abstract: The immunological and pathological consequences of parasite infection can be more rigorously assessed from experimental manipulation than from correlational studies of natural infections. We used anthelmintic treatment to experimentally decrease intensities of lungworm infection in captive and free-ranging wild cane toads to assess parasite impacts on host immune responses. First, we administered the anthelmintic drug Ivermectin to both infected and uninfected toads, to distinguish drug effects per se from the impacts of killing lungworms. Worms began dying and decomposing <48 h after injection. The only immunological variables that were affected by anthelmintic treatment were bactericidal capacity of the blood which increased in parasitized toads (presumably triggered by decomposing worms in the lungs), and the phagocytic capacity of blood (which increased in both infected and uninfected toads); the latter effect presumably was caused by the injection of Ivermectin per se rather than removal of parasites. Second, we looked at correlates of variation in the infection intensity induced by de-worming (in both captive and free-ranging toads) over an eight-week period. Heavier lungworm infection was associated with increased phagocytic ability of the host's blood, and a reduction in the host's liver mass (and hence, energy stores). Experimental de-worming thus revealed pathological and immunological costs of the presence of lungworms, and of their removal by anthelmintic injection.

  CSV Title: A global perspective on domestic energy deprivation: Overcoming the energy poverty-fuel poverty binary
  CSV Abstract: This paper offers an integrated conceptual framework for the research and amelioration of energy deprivation in the home. It starts from the premise that all forms of energy and fuel poverty - in developed and developing countries alike - are underpinned by a common condition: the inability to attain a socially and materially necessitated level of domestic energy services. We consider the functionings provided by energy demand in the residential domain in order to advance two claims: first, that domestic energy deprivation in its different guises and forms is fundamentally tied to the ineffective operation of the socio-technical pathways that allow for the fulfilment of household energy needs, and as such is best analyzed by understanding the constitution of different energy services (heating, lighting, etc.) in the home. Second, we emphasize the ability of vulnerability thinking to encapsulate the driving forces of domestic energy deprivation via a comprehensive analytical matrix. The paper identifies the main components and implications of energy service and vulnerability approaches as they relate to domestic energy deprivation across the world.

  CSV Title: Custom mentholation of commercial cigarettes for research purposes
  CSV Abstract: In the U.S. menthol remains the sole permitted characterizing cigarette flavor additive in part because efforts to link menthol cigarette use to increased tobacco-related disease risk have been inconclusive. To perform definitive studies, cigarettes that differ only in menthol content are required, yet these are not commercially available. We prepared research cigarettes differing only in menthol content by deposition of l-menthol vapor directly onto commercial nonmenthol cigarettes, and developed a method to measure a cigarette's menthol and nicotine content. With our custom-mentholation technique we achieved the desired moderately high menthol content (as compared to commercial brands) of 6.7. ±. 1.0. mg/g (. n=. 25) without perturbing the cigarettes' nicotine content (17.7. ±. 0.7. mg/g [. n=. 25]). We also characterized other pertinent attributes of our custom-mentholated cigarettes, including percent transmission of menthol and nicotine to mainstream smoke and the rate of loss of menthol over time during storage at room temperature. We are currently using this simple mentholation technique to investigate the differences in human exposure to selected chemicals in cigarette smoke due only to the presence of the added menthol. Our cigarettes will also aid in the elucidation of the effects of menthol on the toxicity of tobacco smoke.

  CSV Title: Structure analysis of vitusite glass–ceramic waste forms using extended X-ray absorption fine structures
  CSV Abstract: Vitusite glass–ceramic waste forms were developed and the local environments of the Nd3+ ions in the waste forms were analyzed using extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. A second shell was observed in the Fourier transform (FT) of the EXAFS Nd LIII-edge spectra with the formation of vitusite crystals in the glass matrix. This second shell was attributed to the presence of the Nd–P and Nd–Na ion pairs constituting the vitusite crystal. The preferred incorporation of Nd3+, P5+, and Na+ inside the crystalline phases surrounded by the glass matrix increased the chemical durability of the glass–ceramics.

  CSV Title: Rac1 Controls Both the Secretory Function of the Mammary Gland and Its Remodeling for Successive Gestations
  CSV Abstract: An important feature of the mammary gland is its ability to undergo repeated morphological changes during each reproductive cycle with profound tissue expansion in pregnancy and regression in involution. However, the mechanisms that determine the tissue's cyclic regenerative capacity remain elusive. We have now discovered that Cre-Lox ablation of Rac1 in mammary epithelia causes gross enlargement of the epithelial tree and defective alveolar regeneration in a second pregnancy. Architectural defects arise because loss of Rac1 disrupts clearance in involution following the first lactation. We show that Rac1 is crucial for mammary alveolar epithelia to switch from secretion to a phagocytic mode and rapidly remove dying neighbors. Moreover, Rac1 restricts the extrusion of dying cells into the lumen, thus promoting their eradication by live phagocytic neighbors while within the epithelium. Without Rac1, residual milk and cell corpses flood the ductal network, causing gross dilation, chronic inflammation, and defective future regeneration.

  CSV Title: A landscape-based cluster analysis using recursive search instead of a threshold parameter
  CSV Abstract: Cluster-based analysis methods in neuroimaging provide control of whole-brain false positive rates without the need to conservatively correct for the number of voxels and the associated false negative results. The current method defines clusters based purely on shapes in the landscape of activation, instead of requiring the choice of a statistical threshold that may strongly affect results. Statistical significance is determined using permutation testing, combining both size and height of activation. A method is proposed for dealing with relatively small local peaks. Simulations confirm the method controls the false positive rate and correctly identifies regions of activation. The method is also illustrated using real data. • A landscape-based method to define clusters in neuroimaging data avoids the need to pre-specify a threshold to define clusters.• The implementation of the method works as expected, based on simulated and real data.• The recursive method used for defining clusters, the method used for combining clusters, and the definition of the “value” of a cluster may be of interest for future variations.

  CSV Title: The costs and gains of policy options for coordinating electricity generation in the Gulf Cooperation Council
  CSV Abstract: We investigate the economic impacts of policies for coordinating electricity production in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) through electricity trade. The GCC countries have installed a network of high-voltage transmission lines that links Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. The Interconnector has successfully provided reliability services but has not yet realized its full potential as a platform to fully integrate the individual electricity systems. We perform a static analysis of 2015 using a partial equilibrium model with detailed power generation and water production sectors for each country. We calculate economic losses and gains for each country and in aggregate before and after coordination through electricity trade. We first assess the potential gains from coordination subject to the existing national policies for fuel subsidies. We then consider coordination when fuel inputs are not subsidized. Finally, we devise a scenario that aims to retain the benefits of coordination without removing fuel subsidies. Our results indicate that subsidy removal is necessary for each country to gain from electricity trade. Removing fuel subsidies provides the bulk of economic gains: $42.6 billion. Utilizing the Interconnector further increases annual gains by $1.1 billion.

  CSV Title: Low-Dose Nitric Oxide as Targeted Anti-biofilm Adjunctive Therapy to Treat Chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infection in Cystic Fibrosis
  CSV Abstract: Despite aggressive antibiotic therapy, bronchopulmonary colonization by Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes persistent morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF). Chronic P. aeruginosa infection in the CF lung is associated with structured, antibiotic-tolerant bacterial aggregates known as biofilms. We have demonstrated the effects of non-bactericidal, low-dose nitric oxide (NO), a signaling molecule that induces biofilm dispersal, as a novel adjunctive therapy for P. aeruginosa biofilm infection in CF in an ex vivo model and a proof-of-concept double-blind clinical trial. Submicromolar NO concentrations alone caused disruption of biofilms within ex vivo CF sputum and a statistically significant decrease in ex vivo biofilm tolerance to tobramycin and tobramycin combined with ceftazidime. In the 12-patient randomized clinical trial, 10 ppm NO inhalation caused significant reduction in P. aeruginosa biofilm aggregates compared with placebo across 7 days of treatment. Our results suggest a benefit of using low-dose NO as adjunctive therapy to enhance the efficacy of antibiotics used to treat acute P. aeruginosa exacerbations in CF. Strategies to induce the disruption of biofilms have the potential to overcome biofilm-associated antibiotic tolerance in CF and other biofilm-related diseases.

  CSV Title: Aspidogastrea africanus Infections, comparative assessment of BTEX and heavy metals Bioaccumulation, and histopathological alterations as biomarker response in Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus (Lacépède, 1803)of Lekki Lagoon, Nigeria
  CSV Abstract: The study was carried out on 120 randomly selected fresh specimens of Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus (males and females of different trophic levels)from Lekki lagoon, Lagos, Nigeria. The aim was to investigate the heavy metals and endoparasitic infection in the fish. We compared the impacts of both stressors on the liver and intestine of C. nigrodigitatus. Water samples were tested for pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), salinity, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids using a multiprobe meter. Nitrate, nitrite, phosphorus, ammonia, total suspended solids and colour were measured using VR 5000 spectrophotometer. Alkalinity, acidity, biological oxygen demand (BOD)and chloride were measured via Titrimetry method. Chemical oxygen demand (COD)was measured via a closed reflux titration., and turbidity was measured via a VR 2010. Aspidogastrea africanus was the only parasitic infection detected in C. nigrodigitatus; though of low intensity. We also observed low heavy metal levels in the environmental media tested. However, the study showed that the liver and intestinal tissues of C. nigrodigitatus were slightly impacted by the stressors even at low levels. We therefore suspect synergy between Aspidogasrea infection and heavy metals toxicity. We recommend a further biomonitoring of the aquatic environment in order to ascertain the actual causative factors contributing to tissue injuries in the fish. Findings will help mitigate future aggravation of the tissue toxicity. Low levels of Aspidogastrea infection is an early prognostic information against outbreak of the disease in the aquatic environment.

  CSV Title: Adaptation of targeted nanocarriers to changing requirements in antimalarial drug delivery
  CSV Abstract: The adaptation of existing antimalarial nanocarriers to new Plasmodium stages, drugs, targeting molecules, or encapsulating structures is a strategy that can provide new nanotechnology-based, cost-efficient therapies against malaria. We have explored the modification of different liposome prototypes that had been developed in our group for the targeted delivery of antimalarial drugs to Plasmodium-infected red blood cells (pRBCs). These new models include: (i) immunoliposome-mediated release of new lipid-based antimalarials; (ii) liposomes targeted to pRBCs with covalently linked heparin to reduce anticoagulation risks; (iii) adaptation of heparin to pRBC targeting of chitosan nanoparticles; (iv) use of heparin for the targeting of Plasmodium stages in the mosquito vector; and (v) use of the non-anticoagulant glycosaminoglycan chondroitin 4-sulfate as a heparin surrogate for pRBC targeting. The results presented indicate that the tuning of existing nanovessels to new malaria-related targets is a valid low-cost alternative to the de novo development of targeted nanosystems.

  CSV Title: Different levels of probiotics affect growth, survival and body composition of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) cultured in low input ponds
  CSV Abstract: A 7-month experiment was carried out to determine the effects of different levels of probiotics (baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and Bacillus subtilis) on Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) reared in low input ponds. Monosex male fingerlings (40 g) were randomly distributed into 28, 1.25 m3 net cages at 50 fish m−3 and fed twice daily at 3% body weight on seven isonitrogenous (28% crude protein) diets supplemented with either Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1 × 1010 CFU g−1) or Bacillus subtilis (1 × 109 CFU g−1) at different levels: Diet 0 (control); Diet 1–3 were supplemented with S. cerevisiae at 2 g kg −1 (Diet 1); 4 g kg−1 (Diet 2) and 6 g kg −1 (Diet 3) whereas Diet 4–6 were supplemented with B. subtilis at 5 g kg−1 (Diet 4); 10 g kg−1 (Diet 5) and 15 g kg−1 (Diet 6). Higher final weight (255.31 ± 3.19), Specific Growth rates (SGR) (0.77±0.01) and better Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) (1.61 ± 0.02) were recorded in fish fed on Diet 2 followed by fish fed on Diet 5. Fish fed on probiotic- supplemented diets had significantly better growth, nutrient utilization and FCR compared to fish fed on the control diet (P < 0.05). Probiotic supplementation significantly affected the body composition of the fish (P < 0.05). S. cerevisiae led to significantly high protein (86.06%) at 4 g kg−1 (Diet 2) (P < 0.05) while B. subtilis led to significantly higher protein (89.40%) at 5 g kg−1 (Diet 4) (P < 0.05). Crude lipid and ash content were significantly lower in the fish fed on probiotic supplemented diets (P < 0.05) compared to the control. This study has demonstrated that the application of probiotics in diets of Nile tilapia in low input ponds promotes growth and enhances body composition. The two probiotics have got different effects depending on the level of application. S. cerevisiae exhibited the best performance at 4 g kg−1 while B. subtilis had the best performance at 10 g kg−1.

  CSV Title: ‘All chemical substances are harmful.’ public appraisal of uncertain risks of food additives and contaminants
  CSV Abstract: In toxicological health risk assessment, epistemic uncertainties (e.g. about a chemical's intrinsic properties or toxicity) often remain, preventing definitive statements about whether a chemical constitues a risk. In this study, we analyzed public appraisals of uncertain risks of food additives and contaminants. We identified three major characteristics of public appraisal. First, hazard appraisals differed consistently from risk appraisals: respondents were less disturbed by a possible health risk than by the mere presence of the chemical substance in food. Second, while a majority understood that exposure determines whether a chemical constitutes a risk, many respondents thought that all chemicals are equally harmful. This suggests a mismatch between beliefs about exposure and beliefs about toxicity. Finally, the higher people valued certainty about food safety and the less they considered uncertainty about a risk acceptable, the more severe they appraised the presence of the chemical substance in food. This suggests that a mismatch between the level of uncertainty that people expect about food safety and the actual level of scientific uncertainty, affects how people evaluate the presence of chemical substances in food. Following the findings, implications for risk communication are discussed.

  CSV Title: Fishery-induced changes to age and length dependent maturation schedules of three demersal fish species in the Firth of Clyde
  CSV Abstract: Probabilistic maturation reaction norms (PMRNs) were used to investigate the maturation schedules of cod, haddock and whiting in the Firth of Clyde to determine if typical lengths at maturation have changed significantly since 1986. Some potential sources of growth-independent plasticity were accounted for by including sea-surface temperature and abundance variables in the analysis. The PMRNs of the Clyde populations were compared with those from the wider west coast, in conjunction with regional differences in the fishery, to assess whether fishing may have been driving the observed trends of decreasing lengths at maturation. The lengths at which haddock, whiting and female cod were likely to mature decreased significantly during 1986-2009, with rates of change being particularly rapid in the Clyde. It was not possible to estimate PMRNs for male cod due to limited data. Trends in temperature and abundance were shown to have only marginal affects upon PMRN positions, so temporal trends in maturation schedules appear to have been due to a combination of plastic responses to other environmental variables and/or fishing. Regional differences in fishing intensity and the size-selectivity of the fisheries suggest that the decreases in lengths at maturation have been at least partially due to fishing. The importance and scale of the Clyde Nephrops fishery increased as demersal landings declined, and the majority of demersal fish landings have come from Nephrops bycatch since about 2005 when the demersal fishery ceased. Since it appears as though fishing may have caused increasingly early maturation, and a substantial Nephrops fishery continues to operate in the Clyde, reversal of these changes is likely to take a long time - particularly if there is an evolutionary component to the trends. If size-selective fishing has contributed to the lowered abundance of large fish by encouraging maturation at increasingly small lengths, then large fish may remain uncommon in the Clyde until the observed trends in maturation lengths reverse.

  CSV Title: Crystal and electronic structures of substituted halide perovskites based on density functional calculation and molecular dynamics
  CSV Abstract: Durability of organo-lead halide perovskite are important issue for its practical application in a solar cells. In this study, using density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics, we theoretically investigated a crystal structure, electronic structure, and ionic diffusivity of the partially substituted cubic MA0.5X0.5PbI3 (MA = CH3NH3+, X = NH4+ or (NH2)2CH+ or Cs+). Our calculation results indicate that a partial substitution of MA induces a lattice distortion, resulting in preventing MA or X from the diffusion between A sites in the perovskite. DFT calculations show that electronic structures of the investigated partially substituted perovskites were similar with that of MAPbI3, while their bandgaps slightly decrease compared to that of MAPbI3. Our results mean that partial substitution in halide perovskite is effective technique to suppress diffusion of intrinsic ions and tune the band gap.

  CSV Title: Scenarios for shale gas development and their related land use impacts in the Baltic Basin, Northern Poland
  CSV Abstract: Scenarios for potential shale gas development were modelled for the Baltic Basin in Northern Poland for the period 2015-2030 using the land allocation model EUCS100. The main aims were to assess the associated land use requirements, conflicts with existing land use, and the influence of legislation on the environmental impact. The factors involved in estimating the suitability for placement of shale gas well pads were analysed, as well as the potential land and water requirements to define 2 technology-based scenarios, representing the highest and lowest potential environmental impact. 2 different legislative frameworks (current and restrictive) were also assessed, to give 4 combined scenarios altogether. Land consumption and allocation patterns of well pads varied substantially according to the modelled scenario. Potential landscape fragmentation and conflicts with other land users depended mainly on development rate, well pad density, existing land-use patterns, and geology. Highly complex landscapes presented numerous barriers to drilling activities, restricting the potential development patterns. The land used for shale gas development could represent a significant percentage of overall land take within the shale play. The adoption of appropriate legislation, especially the protection of natural areas and water resources, is therefore essential to minimise the related environmental impact.

  CSV Title: Dataset of milk whey proteins of three indigenous Greek sheep breeds
  CSV Abstract: The importance and unique biological traits, as well as the growing financial value, of milk from small Greek ruminants is continuously attracting interest from both the scientific community and industry. In this regard the construction of a reference dataset of the milk of the Greek sheep breeds is of great interest. In order to obtain such a dataset we employed cutting-edge proteomics methodologies to investigate and characterize, the proteome of milk from the three indigenous Greek sheep breeds Mpoutsko, Karagouniko and Chios. In total, more than 1300 protein groups were identified in milk whey from these breeds, reporting for the first time the most detailed proteome dataset of this precious biological material. The present results are further discussed in the research paper "Milk of Greek sheep and goat breeds; characterization by means of proteomics" (Anagnostopoulos et al. 2016) [1].

  CSV Title: Steam gasification of biomass with subsequent syngas adjustment using shift reaction for syngas production: An Aspen Plus model
  CSV Abstract: A simulation model of biomass gasification for syngas production with steam as gasifying agent and subsequent syngas adjustment has been developed using Aspen Plus. The developed model is based on Gibbs free energy minimization applying the restricted equilibrium method. The objective is to study the effect of important parameters such as gasification temperature, steam to biomass ratio and shift reaction temperature on hydrogen concentration, CO concentration, CO conversion, CO2 conversion and H2/CO ratio in the syngas. Simulations were performed for different biomass feedstocks to predict their syngas composition. The hydrogen and CO concentrations were altered such that the H2/CO molar ratio in the syngas composition gets adjusted close to a value of 2.15 as required for FT synthesis by the shift reaction. The present model has been validated with experimental data from literature on steam biomass gasification conducted in a research scale fluidized bed gasifier. The product gas obtained from steam gasification of food wastes resulted in a composition with a H2/CO molar ratio close to 2.15 which can be directly fed to a Fischer-Tropsch synthesis plant whereas remaining feedstocks requires a syngas adjustment either by WGS or RWGS reactions to achieve H2/CO molar ratio close to 2.15.

  CSV Title: Independent evolution of genomic characters during major metazoan transitions
  CSV Abstract: Metazoan evolution encompasses a vast evolutionary time scale spanning over 600 million years. Our ability to infer ancestral metazoan characters, both morphological and functional, is limited by our understanding of the nature and evolutionary dynamics of the underlying regulatory networks. Increasing coverage of metazoan genomes enables us to identify the evolutionary changes of the relevant genomic characters such as the loss or gain of coding sequences, gene duplications, micro- and macro-synteny, and non-coding element evolution in different lineages. In this review we describe recent advances in our understanding of ancestral metazoan coding and non-coding features, as deduced from genomic comparisons. Some genomic changes such as innovations in gene and linkage content occur at different rates across metazoan clades, suggesting some level of independence among genomic characters. While their contribution to biological innovation remains largely unclear, we review recent literature about certain genomic changes that do correlate with changes to specific developmental pathways and metazoan innovations. In particular, we discuss the origins of the recently described pharyngeal cluster which is conserved across deuterostome genomes, and highlight different genomic features that have contributed to the evolution of this group. We also assess our current capacity to infer ancestral metazoan states from gene models and comparative genomics tools and elaborate on the future directions of metazoan comparative genomics relevant to evo-devo studies.

  CSV Title: Current mechanistic insights into the role of infection in systemic lupus erythematosus
  CSV Abstract: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and abnormal production of autoantibody, but the mechanisms of the aberrant immune responses are currently unknown. Recently, growing evidence has suggested that infection plays a pivotal role in SLE. Here, we investigate the role of infectious agents (e.g., Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus B19, human T-lymphotropic virus type 1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1, and endogenous retroviruses) in the pathogenesis of SLE. More importantly, we explore the known mechanisms underlying the involvement of infectious agents in the pathogenesis of SLE, including molecular mimicry, epitope spreading, superantigen production, bystander activation, persistent viral infection, altered apoptosis, clearance deficiency, and epigenetic alterations (e.g., DNA methylation and microRNAs). However, some infectious agents (e.g., malaria parasites, hepatitis B virus, Toxoplasma gondii, and Helicobacter pylori) may exert protective effects on SLE. Therefore, the relationship between infection and SLE is multifaceted and multidirectional, including causative and/or protective associations, which warrant further investigation in the future.

  CSV Title: Rapidly progressive hip disease—A rare entity in Korean population
  CSV Abstract: Introduction: The pathophysiology of rapidly progressive hip disease is still unclear. It is a rare subset of osteoarthritis that mainly affects elderly women and presents with new- onset severe hip pain and dysfunction. It is assumed to be triggered by extremely rapid osteoarthritic changes resulting in impaction of the femoral head into the acetabulum, with successive osteonecrosis and insufficiency of the femoral head. Presentation of the case: A 62- year-old woman reported of right hip pain which succeeded an acetabular fracture for which open reduction and fixation was done. Initial radiographs, post fixation, showed no obvious abnormality. After 2 months of conservative therapy for her right hip pain, radiographs showed joint space reduction and subchondral bone loss. T1 MRI images revealed marrow oedema pattern and depression of the articular surface of the femoral head. Discussion: Differential diagnosis includes conditions which potentially lead to rapid hip destruction, such as metabolic bone diseases, autoimmune inflammatory arthritis and classical osteonecrosis. In patients with rapid worsening of hip symptoms successive X-rays and a high degree of clinical suspicion towards RPHD is essential to avoid extensive joint destruction and to facilitate better arthroplasty outcomes. Conclusion: The authors propose that this case represent an uncommon subset of osteoarthritis. Regular review, both clinically and radiologically, is required to assess speed of progression and to prevent rapid loss of bone stock without the surgeon being aware.

  CSV Title: Variable exon usage of differentially-expressed genes associated with resistance of sheep to Teladorsagia circumcincta
  CSV Abstract: The resistance and susceptibility of sheep to the common abomasal nematode parasite, Teladorsagia circumcincta is strongly associated with the differential polarization of the immune response. Resistant animals control larval colonization by the production of a protective antibody response regulated by Th2 T cells. Susceptible sheep respond to infection by developing an inflammatory Th1/Th17 response that fails to control infection. Previous microarray analysis identified genes associated with T cell polarization that were differentially expressed between the resistant and susceptible sheep. RT-qPCR confirmed the microarray data for ALOX15 and IL13. Both ALOX15 exon 9 and IL13 exon 4 were significantly increased in resistant animals and copy number RT-qPCR showed that expression levels of these exons were significantly negatively correlated with quantitative phenotypic traits, including abomasal worm counts and faecal egg counts. Sequencing of the intronic regions 5' to these genes failed to identify any potential genetic links to differential exon usage.

  CSV Title: Kinetic models of metabolism that consider alternative steady-state solutions of intracellular fluxes and concentrations
  CSV Abstract: Large-scale kinetic models are used for designing, predicting, and understanding the metabolic responses of living cells. Kinetic models are particularly attractive for the biosynthesis of target molecules in cells as they are typically better than other types of models at capturing the complex cellular biochemistry. Using simpler stoichiometric models as scaffolds, kinetic models are built around a steady-state flux profile and a metabolite concentration vector that are typically determined via optimization. However, as the underlying optimization problem is underdetermined, even after incorporating available experimental omics data, one cannot uniquely determine the operational configuration in terms of metabolic fluxes and metabolite concentrations. As a result, some reactions can operate in either the forward or reverse direction while still agreeing with the observed physiology. Here, we analyze how the underlying uncertainty in intracellular fluxes and concentrations affects predictions of constructed kinetic models and their design in metabolic engineering and systems biology studies. To this end, we integrated the omics data of optimally grown Escherichia coli into a stoichiometric model and constructed populations of non-linear large-scale kinetic models of alternative steady-state solutions consistent with the physiology of the E. coli aerobic metabolism. We performed metabolic control analysis (MCA) on these models, highlighting that MCA-based metabolic engineering decisions are strongly affected by the selected steady state and appear to be more sensitive to concentration values rather than flux values. To incorporate this into future studies, we propose a workflow for moving towards more reliable and robust predictions that are consistent with all alternative steady-state solutions. This workflow can be applied to all kinetic models to improve the consistency and accuracy of their predictions. Additionally, we show that, irrespective of the alternative steady-state solution, increased activity of phosphofructokinase and decreased ATP maintenance requirements would improve cellular growth of optimally grown E. coli.

  CSV Title: Development of a novel equine influenza virus live-attenuated vaccine
  CSV Abstract: H3N8 equine influenza virus (EIV) is an important and significant respiratory pathogen of horses. EIV is enzootic in Europe and North America, mainly due to the suboptimal efficacy of current vaccines. We describe, for the first time, the generation of a temperature sensitive (ts) H3N8 EIV live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) using reverse-genetics approaches. Our EIV LAIV was attenuated (att) in vivo and able to induce, upon a single intranasal administration, protection against H3N8 EIV wild-type (WT) challenge in both a mouse model and the natural host, the horse. Notably, since our EIV LAIV was generated using reverse genetics, the vaccine can be easily updated against drifting or emerging strains of EIV using the safety backbone of our EIV LAIV as master donor virus (MDV). These results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a novel EIV LAIV approach for the prevention and control of currently circulating H3N8 EIVs in horse populations.

  CSV Title: Optimizing sampling strategy for Chinese National Sewage Sludge Survey (CNSSS) based on urban agglomeration, wastewater treatment process, and treatment capacity
  CSV Abstract: As a sink and source of contaminants, sewage sludge is a good matrix to capture the spatial-temporal trend of chemicals and assess the potential risks these chemicals pose to human health and the environment. In order to understand these chemical risks, a robust statistical sewage sludge sampling strategy for Chinese wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) must be designed. The purpose of this paper is to develop such a sampling strategy for Chinese WWTPs which may be used optimally. Before creating the sampling design, the distribution of WWTPs was categorically analyzed. These categories include urban agglomeration, wastewater treatment process, and wastewater treatment capacity. Particular attention was given to the studying of population distribution, gross domestic product, WWTP number, wastewater treatment flow, and dry sludge production in each urban agglomeration. In addition, correlation analysis was conducted among these five indexes. Due to the heterogeneity of WWTPs, stratified sampling had to be used to homogenize the sampling units. The eight strategies proposed herein were based on simple random sampling and stratified random sampling methods. Moreover, the aforementioned three categories (urban agglomeration, treatment process, and treatment capacity) were intended to be stratification indicators. Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulations revealed that the treatment capacity based stratified random sampling strategy (Strategy 4) results in the optimal sample representation, with the smallest root mean square error compared to seven other sampling strategies with different strata. This optimal stratified sampling strategy, if employed during the Chinese national sewage sludge survey, has the potential to greatly contribute to data quality and assurance.

  CSV Title: Appraisal framework for actor interest and power analysis in forest management - Insights from Northern Portugal
  CSV Abstract: Forest management is currently challenged by the need to address an increasing demand for a wide range of ecosystem services. Addressing this challenge requires landscape-level supply approaches that may bring together multiple interests and goals of forest actors. Characterizing these interests and the corresponding forest management context is thus a prerequisite for an effective landscape-level approach. In this manuscript we develop actor analysis to characterize a forest management context. We implement and test the analysis in Vale do Sousa, in North-Western Portugal. The analysis encompassed the identification of key actors and 40 interviews. Results show that the analysis provides a thorough diagnosis of the current forest management context in Vale do Sousa. The findings give a snapshot of the actors and factors – interests, influential actors, conflicts, problems and power resources – that frame forest decisions. Specifically, results show the keen interest of all groups on wood provisioning and on regulating wildfires. However, actors have also revealed a strong interest in water quality, soil erosion prevention, biodiversity, landscape aesthetics and environmental education. Thus, there is a significant interest in the diversification of the provision of ecosystem services. Almost half of the actors have identified the multifunctional forest as being the ideal forest management framework for Vale do Sousa. Findings thus evince the potential of a participatory approach to negotiate a consensual landscape-level solution that may integrate the different actors' interests and provide a wide range of ecosystem services. This may be facilitated by another finding from actor analysis. A regional Forest Owners Association was recognized as the most influential actor and may support the development and negotiation of multiple objective landscape-level forest ecosystem management plans. In summary, these results may contribute to a better understanding of the forest management context in Vale do Sousa and to supporting the effectiveness of forest management planning. They may contribute further to anticipate problems and conflicts and to develop with actors from Vale do Sousa participatory processes to address them.

  CSV Abstract: A compound structure metamaterial containing a metal particles array embedded in a dielectric layer is designed and simulated. The absorption property is modulated through changing horizontal (H) or vertical (V) distances between two metallic particles. The interaction and coupling between LSP modes enhances of the absorption performance. Two absorption bands are revealed based on the maximum resonance strength of the coupling effect. The absorbing properties are modulated due to the Ge2Sb2Te5 layer is temperature sensitive. The effect of the thickness of the dielectric layer on the absorption performance is also revealed.

  CSV Title: The hibernating mobile phone: Dead storage as a barrier to efficient electronic waste recovery
  CSV Abstract: Hibernation, the dead storage period when a mobile phone is still retained by the user at its end-of-life, is both a common and a significant barrier to the effective flow of time-sensitive stock value within a circular economic model. In this paper we present the findings of a survey of 181 mobile phone owners, aged between 18–25 years old, living and studying in the UK, which explored mobile phone ownership, reasons for hibernation, and replacement motives. This paper also outlines and implements a novel mechanism for quantifying the mean hibernation period based on the survey findings. The results show that only 33.70% of previously owned mobile phones were returned back into the system. The average duration of ownership of mobile phones kept and still in hibernation was 4 years 11 months, with average use and hibernation durations of 1 year 11 months, and 3 years respectively; on average, mobile phones that are kept by the user are hibernated for longer than they are ever actually used as primary devices. The results also indicate that mobile phone replacement is driven primarily by physical (technological, functional and absolute) obsolescence, with economic obsolescence, partly in response to the notion of being ‘due an upgrade’, also featuring significantly. We also identify in this paper the concept of a secondary phone, a recently replaced phone that holds a different function for the user than their primary phone but is still valued and intentionally retained by the user, and which, we conclude, should be accounted for in any reverse logistics strategy.

  CSV Title: Enzymatic antioxidant responses and mineral status in roots and leaves of olive plants subjected to fluoride stress
  CSV Abstract: Fluoride (F) as one of the most toxic pollutants affecting the environment severely restricted plant growth and development. The Fluoride toxicity was studied in young olive plants (Olea europaea L. cv Chemlali), which were irrigated for 5 months with increasing NaF concentration: 0 (control), 20, 40, and 80 mM NaF. The NaF application resulted in an increase of the F content in plant tissues with a higher level in roots compared to leaves. Olive plants treated with 20 or 40 mM NaF maintained their mineral status and activated their antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase). In fact, lipid peroxidation and electrolyte leakage were not affected in the plant leaves. However, olive plants treated with 80 mM NaF showed (i) the highest reduction of antioxidant enzyme activities and mineral contents, and (ii) an increase of oxidative stress markers such as hydrogen peroxide, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and electrolyte leakage in both roots and leaves.

  CSV Title: Dataset to delineate changes in association between Akt1 and its interacting partners as a function of active state of Akt1 protein
  CSV Abstract: Akt1 is a multi-functional protein, implicated in multiple human solid tumors. Pertaining to its key role in cell survival, Akt1 is under focus for development of targeted therapies. Functional diversity of Akt1 is a result of its interactions with other proteins; which changes with changing context. This investigation was designed to capture the dynamics of Akt1 Interactome as a function of its active state. Delineating dynamic changes in association of Akt1 with its interactors could help us comprehend how it changes as a function of inhibition of its active form. Similar information on changes in Akt1 interactome as of now is not well explored. Akt1 expressing HEK293 cells were cultured in light and heavy labeled SILAC media. Normal lysine and arginine were incorporated as light labels while for heavy labeling the isotopes were 8 and 10 Da heavier. Light labeled cells represented the indigenous state of Akt1 interactome while heavy labeled cells represented Akt1 interactome in presence of its allosteric inhibitor, MK-2206. Equal number of cells from both conditions were pooled, lysed and subjected to Affinity Purification coupled to Mass Spectroscopy (AP-MS). Additionally, SILAC labeling aided in quantitative estimation of changing association of a number of proteins which were common to the two experimental conditions, with Akt1. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD005976.

  CSV Title: Inhibitory receptor expression on memory CD8 T cells following Ad vector immunization
  CSV Abstract: T cells are an important component of immune responses, and their function is influenced by their expression of inhibitory receptors. Immunization with alternative serotype adenovirus (Ad) vectors induces highly functional T cell responses with lower programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) expression and increased boostability relative to Ad5 vectors. However, a detailed phenotypic characterization of other inhibitory receptors is lacking, and it is unknown whether Ad5-induced CD8 T cells eventually recover function with time. In this report, we measure the expression of various inhibitory receptors and memory markers during early and late time points following vaccination with Ad5 and alternative serotype Ad vectors. CD8 T cells induced by Ad5 exhibited increased expression of the inhibitory receptor Tim-3 and showed decreased central memory differentiation as compared with alternative serotype Ad vectors, even a year following immunization. Moreover, relative to Ad5-primed mice, Ad26-primed mice exhibited substantially improved recall of SIV Gag-specific CD8 T cell responses following heterologous boosting with MVA or Ad35 vectors. We also demonstrate that low doses of Ad5 priming resulted in more boostable immune responses with lower PD-1 expression as compared to high Ad5 doses, suggesting a role for vector dose in influencing immune dysfunction following Ad5 vaccination. These data suggest that Ad5 vectors induce a long-term pattern of immune exhaustion that can be partly overcome by lowering vector dose and modulating inhibitory signals.

  CSV Title: Integration and relative value of biomarkers for prediction of MCI to AD progression: Spatial patterns of brain atrophy, cognitive scores, APOE genotype and CSF biomarkers
  CSV Abstract: This study evaluates the individual, as well as relative and joint value of indices obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) patterns of brain atrophy (quantified by the SPARE-AD index), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, APOE genotype, and cognitive performance (ADAS-Cog) in progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) within a variable follow-up period up to 6 years, using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-1 (ADNI-1). SPARE-AD was first established as a highly sensitive and specific MRI-marker of AD vs. cognitively normal (CN) subjects (AUC = 0.98). Baseline predictive values of all aforementioned indices were then compared using survival analysis on 381 MCI subjects. SPARE-AD and ADAS-Cog were found to have similar predictive value, and their combination was significantly better than their individual performance. APOE genotype did not significantly improve prediction, although the combination of SPARE-AD, ADAS-Cog and APOE ε4 provided the highest hazard ratio estimates of 17.8 (last vs. first quartile). In a subset of 192 MCI patients who also had CSF biomarkers, the addition of Aβ1-42, t-tau, and p-tau181p to the previous model did not improve predictive value significantly over SPARE-AD and ADAS-Cog combined. Importantly, in amyloid-negative patients with MCI, SPARE-AD had high predictive power of clinical progression. Our findings suggest that SPARE-AD and ADAS-Cog in combination offer the highest predictive power of conversion from MCI to AD, which is improved, albeit not significantly, by APOE genotype. The finding that SPARE-AD in amyloid-negative MCI patients was predictive of clinical progression is not expected under the amyloid hypothesis and merits further investigation. © 2013 The Authors.

  CSV Title: Functional Landscape of PCGF Proteins Reveals Both RING1A/B-Dependent-and RING1A/B-Independent-Specific Activities
  CSV Abstract: Polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2) control cell identity by establishing facultative heterochromatin repressive domains at common sets of target genes. PRC1, which deposits H2Aub1 through the E3 ligases RING1A/B, forms six biochemically distinct subcomplexes depending on the assembled PCGF protein (PCGF1–PCGF6); however, it is yet unclear whether these subcomplexes have also specific activities. Here we show that PCGF1 and PCGF2 largely compensate for each other, while other PCGF proteins have high levels of specificity for distinct target genes. PCGF2 associates with transcription repression, whereas PCGF3 and PCGF6 associate with actively transcribed genes. Notably, PCGF3 and PCGF6 complexes can assemble and be recruited to several active sites independently of RING1A/B activity (therefore, of PRC1). For chromatin recruitment, the PCGF6 complex requires the combinatorial activities of its MGA-MAX and E2F6-DP1 subunits, while PCGF3 requires an interaction with the USF1 DNA binding transcription factor. PRC1 encompasses different sub-complexes with distinct biochemical properties. Scelfo et al. dissect these activities, highlighting their little redundancy and high functional specificity. PRC1 sub-complexes associate specifically with transcriptional repression or activation, can function independently of the core RING1A/B enzymes, and can be recruited to chromatin by specific DNA binding activities.

  CSV Title: Live imaging of the genetically intractable obligate intracellular bacteria Orientia tsutsugamushi using a panel of fluorescent dyes
  CSV Abstract: Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of bacterial infection and pathogenesis are disproportionally derived from a small number of well-characterised species and strains. One reason for this is the enormous time and resources required to develop a new organism into experimental system that can be interrogated at the molecular level, in particular with regards to the development of genetic tools. Live cell imaging by fluorescence microscopy is a powerful technique to study biological processes such as bacterial motility, host cell invasion, and bacterial growth and division. In the absence of genetic tools that enable exogenous expression of fluorescent proteins, fluorescent chemical probes can be used to label and track living cells. A large number of fluorescent chemical probes are commercially available, but these have overwhelmingly been applied to the study of eukaryotic cell systems. Here, we present a methodical analysis of four different classes of probes, which can be used to delineate the cytoplasm, nucleic acids, cell membrane or peptidoglycan of living bacterial cells. We have tested these in the context of the important but neglected human pathogen Orientia tsutsugamushi but expect that the methodology would be broadly applicable to other bacterial species.

  CSV Title: Evaluation of multidrug resistance patterns in siderophore-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa from clinical and environmental samples in Gorgan, Iran
  CSV Abstract: Siderophores secreted by nonfermentative negative bacilli such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa are capable of increasing rates of resistance to carbapenem antibiotics. Furthermore, the resistance of these isolates to antibiotics has been enhanced by producing siderophores, and their frequencies have erratic patterns. We studied the outbreak of P. aeruginosa strains and their antibiotic patterns in different clinical samples. In this descriptive cross-sectional study, 100 P. aeruginosa samples were isolated from different clinical specimens at the 5th Azar Hospital, Gorgan, Iran, in 2017. These strains were identified by biochemical tests, and their antibiotic resistance patterns were measured via the disc diffusion method. Next imipenem and EDTA-imipenem (10–30 μg) antibiotics were employed for the detection of siderophores. Amongst 100 P. aeruginosa samples, 31 isolates (31%) were siderophore carriers. The frequency of this enzyme among specimens was as follows: 56.2% in burn wounds, 36.4% in urine, 22.2% in respiratory secretion, 19.4% in blood and 16.7% in wounds (p > 0.05). Moreover, P. aeruginosa isolates producing siderophores had the highest range of resistance to ciprofloxacin (47.6%), gentamicin (46.7%), ceftazidime (34.9%), nalidixic acid (34.3%), amikacin (34.1%) and cefotaxime (31.6%). The prevalence of siderophore producers, and especially their antibiotic patterns have no specific algorithms; in addition, an antibiogram is recommended to identify the most effective antibiotics against those isolates.

  CSV Title: Structural networks in children with autism spectrum disorder with regression: A graph theory study
  CSV Abstract: Background: Regression is frequently described in Autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Limited comprehensive studies have been conducted in patients with ASD with regression. Purpose: To explore the network topological properties in ASD children with (ASD-R) and without (ASD-NR) regression. Methods: In this study, 29 ASD-R, 68 ASD-NR, and 40 children with developmental delay (DD) were recruited. We utilized graph theory to characterize the white matter structure networks by using diffusion tensor imaging and T1-weighted imaging on a 3-T magnetic resonance system. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS (version 23). Results: ANCOVA showed significant differences in global efficiency, characteristic path length and sigma among the ASD-R, ASD-NR and DD groups, but the difference was not significant between the ASD-R and ASD-NR groups. There were 10 common hubs based on regional degree and regional efficiency in all groups. The hubness of the left superior frontal gyrus-dorsolateral, left middle occipital gyrus and right precuneus were enhanced (by regional degree) and that of the right thalamus was reduced (by regional efficiency) in the ASD-R relative to the ASD-NR group. After controlling for the course of regression, the CARS scores were significantly correlated with the regional efficiency of the right precuneus in the ASD-R group. Conclusions: The ASD-R children were different from the ASD-NR children in the distribution of hub regions, although there were no global network property differences between them. In ASD-R children, the right precuneus (PCUN.R) might play an important role and relate to autism symptom severity.

  CSV Title: Ecosystem services or services to ecosystems? Valuing cultivation and reciprocal relationships between humans and ecosystems
  CSV Abstract: The concept of Ecosystem Services (ES), widely understood as the "benefits that humans receive from the natural functioning of healthy ecosystems" (. Jeffers et al., 2015), depicts a one-way flow of services from ecosystems to people. We argue that this conceptualisation is overly simplistic and largely inaccurate, neglecting the reality that humans often contribute to the maintenance and enhancement of ecosystems, as often evidenced (but not exclusively) in many traditional and Indigenous societies. Management interventions arising from Ecosystem Services research are thus potentially damaging to both ecosystems and indigenous rights. We present the concept of 'Services to Ecosystems' (S2E) to address this, closing the loop of the reciprocal relationship between humans and ecosystems. Case studies from the biocultural ecosystems of Amazonia and the Pacific Northwest of North America (Cascadia) are used to illustrate the concept and provide examples of Services to Ecosystems in past and current societies. Finally, an alternative framework is presented, advancing the existing framework for Ecosystem Services by incorporating this reconceptualization and the loop of reciprocity. The framework aims to facilitate the inclusion of Services to Ecosystems in management strategies based upon Ecosystem Services, and highlights the need for ethnographic research in Ecosystem Service-based interventions.

  CSV Title: Understanding demand for higher quality sanitation in peri-urban Lusaka, Zambia through stated and revealed preference analysis
  CSV Abstract: Poor peri-urban sanitation is a significant public health problem, likely to become more important as the world rapidly urbanizes. However, little is known about the role of consumer demand in increasing peri-urban sanitation quality, especially for tenants using shared sanitation as only their rental choices can be observed in the market. We analyzed data on existing housing markets collected between 9 Jun and 6 Jul 2017 using the Hedonic Pricing Method (HPM) to capture the percentage of rent attributable to sanitation quality (n = 933). We also conducted discrete choice experiments (DCEs) to obtain willingness to pay (WTP) estimates for specific sanitation components (n = 1087), and explored the implications by estimating the proportion of plots for which improved sanitation quality would generate a higher return on investment for landlords than building a place for an additional tenant to live. The HPM attributed 18% of rental prices to sanitation (∼US$8.10 per month), but parameters for several components were poorly specified due to collinearity and low overall prevalence of some products. DCEs revealed that tenants were willing to pay $2.20 more rent per month for flushing toilets on plots with running water and $3.39 more per month for solid toilet doors, though they were willing to pay little for simple hole covers and had negative WTP for adding locks to doors (-$1.04). Solid doors and flushing toilets had higher rent increase to cost ratios than other ways landlords commonly invested in their plots, especially as the number of tenant households on a plot increased. DCEs yielded estimates generally consistent with and better specified than HPM and may be useful to estimate demand in other settings. Interventions leveraging landlords' profit motives could lead to significant improvements in peri-urban sanitation quality, reduced diarrheal disease transmission, and increased well-being without subsidies or infrastructure investments by government or NGOs.

  CSV Title: A continuum of HIV care describing mortality and loss to follow-up: a longitudinal cohort study
  CSV Abstract: Background: The cross-sectional HIV care continuum is widely used to assess the success of HIV care programmes among populations of people with HIV and the potential for ongoing transmission. We aimed to investigate whether a longitudinal continuum, which incorporates loss to follow-up and mortality, might provide further insights about the performance of care programmes. Methods: In this longitudinal cohort study, we included individuals who entered the UK Collaborative HIV Cohort (CHIC) study between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2004, and were linked to the national HIV cohort database (HIV and AIDS Reporting System). For each month during a 10 year follow up period, we classified individuals into one of ten distinct categories according to engagement in care, antiretroviral therapy (ART) use, viral suppression, loss to cohort follow-up and loss to care, and mortality, and assessed the proportion of person-months of follow-up spent in each stage of the continuum. 5 year longitudinal continuums were also constructed for three separate cohorts (baseline years of entry 2000–03, 2004–07, and 2008–09) to compare changes over time. Findings: We included 12 811 people contributing 1 537 320 person-months in our analysis. During 10 years of follow-up, individuals spent 811 057 (52·8%) of 1 537 320 person-months on ART. Of the 811 057 person-months spent on ART, individuals had a viral load of 200 copies per mL or less for 607 185 (74·9%) person-months. 10 years after cohort entry, 3612 (28·1%) of 12 811 individuals were lost to follow-up, 954 (26·4%) of whom had transferred to a non-CHIC UK clinic for care. By 10 years, 759 (5·9%) of 12 811 participants who entered the cohort had died. Loss to follow-up decreased and the proportion of person-months that individuals spent virally suppressed increased over calendar time. Interpretation: Loss to follow-up in HIV care programmes was high and rates of viral suppression were lower than previously reported. Complementary information provided by a longitudinal continuum might highlight areas for intervention along the HIV care pathway, however, transfers outside the cohort must be accounted for. Funding: Medical Research Council, UK.

  CSV Title: Multi-parametric rigid and flexible, low-cost, disposable sensing platforms for biomedical applications
  CSV Abstract: The measurement of Na+, K+ and H+ is essential in medicine and plays an important role in the assessment of tissue ischemia. Microfabrication, inkjet- and screen-printing can be used for solid contact ion selective electrodes (ISE) realization; these, however, can be non-standardized, costly and time consuming processes. We present the realization of ISEs on post-processed electrodes fabricated via standardized printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing techniques. In vitro results are presented from two rigid platforms (32 ISEs) for liquid sample dip-stick measurements and two flexible platforms (6 and 32 ISEs) for post-surgical intestinal tissue monitoring, each with a common reference electrode (RE). These are combined with optimized tetrapolar bioimpedance sensors for tissue ischemia detection. Both electroless and hard gold PCB finishes are examined. Apart from the electroless rigid platform, the rest demonstrated comparable and superior performance, with the pH sensors demonstrating the greatest deviation; the flexible hard gold platform achieved a sensitivity 4.6 mV/pH and 49.2 mV/pH greater than the electroless flexible and rigid platforms, respectively. The best overall performance was achieved with the hard gold flexible platform with sensitivities as large as 73.4 mV/pH, 56.3 mV/log [Na+], and 57.4 mV/log [K+] vs. custom REs on the same substrate. Simultaneous measurement of target analytes is demonstrated with test solutions and saliva samples. The results demonstrate superior performance to other PCB-based pH sensors and Na+ and K+ PCB-based sensors with comparable performance to potentiometric sensors fabricated with other techniques, paving the way towards mass-produced, low-cost, disposable, multi-parametric chemical sensing diagnostic platforms.
