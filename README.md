# ACL-26-CiteGCN-LLM
**Citation-Aware Research Paper Classification via Graph Convolutional Networks and Large Language Models**

This repository contains the official implementation of **CiteGCN-LLM**, a unified framework for research paper classification and recommendation that jointly models citation structure and textual semantics using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs).

The framework constructs heterogeneous citation graphs and integrates them with transformer-based textual representations to achieve state-of-the-art performance on scholarly datasets.

## 📌 **Overview**

Scholarly documents are inherently interconnected through citations, authorship, and shared terminology. Purely text-based models fail to capture these relational signals, while graph-only methods lack deep semantic understanding.

**CiteGCN-LLM bridges this gap by:**

- [a](#Modeling citation topology using GCNs)

- [b] (#Extracting contextual semantics from abstracts using pretrained LLMs)

-[c]J (#ointly optimizing both branches under a unified multi-label objective)

# 🧠 **Key Contributions**

Two novel heterogeneous citation graphs

RPCG-1: Paper–Word–Citation graph (TF-IDF + PMI + citations)

RPCG-2: Paper–Author–Citation graph (co-authorship + citations)

Unified GCN–LLM architecture

Structural logits from GCN

Semantic logits from transformer encoder

Joint training with BCEWithLogits loss

Top-K TF-IDF based labeling

Interpretable, personalized multi-label supervision

Extensive evaluation

arXiv, DBLP, Elsevier, and PubMed

Significant gains over GCNs, Graph Transformers, and LLM-only baselines
